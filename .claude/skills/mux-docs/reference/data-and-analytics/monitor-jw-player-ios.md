# Monitor JW Player (iOS)

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-jw-player-ios

In order to integrate Mux Data tracking for your JW Player, you will need to be using JW Player 3.x or later. You will need to already have a JW Player license key and an iOS app with a working implementation of JWPlayer-SDK.


```
pod 'Mux-Stats-JWPlayer', '~> 0.3'
```


This will install Mux-Stats-JWPlayer and the latest current release of our core Objective-C library.

Next, import MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer into your application and call MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer.monitorJWPlayerController, passing in your JW player instance and metadata.


```swift
import MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer;

class VideoPlayerController: UIViewController {
   var player: JWPlayerController?

  override func viewDidLoad ()
      super.viewDidLoad()
    let config = JWConfig()
    config.file = "http://example.com/hls.m3u8"
    player = JWPlayerController(config: config)
  }

  override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
      super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        player!.view!.frame = self.view.bounds
      view.addSubview(player!.view)

      let playName = "iOS JW player"
      let playerData = MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData(environmentKey: "ENV_KEY");
      // insert player metadata
      let videoData = MUXSDKCustomerVideoData();
      // insert video metada
      MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer.monitorJWPlayerController(player!, name: playName, delegate: nil, playerData: playerData!, videoData: videoData)
            player!.play()
  }
}
```


Register a delegate (optional)

If your own ViewController implements ` and you want to use it, then pass that in as the delegate argument to monitorJWPlayerController. See the example below:


```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)
    player!.view!.frame = self.view.bounds
    view.addSubview(player!.view)

    let playName = "iOS JW player"
    let playerData = MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData(environmentKey: "ENV_KEY");
    // insert player metadata
    let videoData = MUXSDKCustomerVideoData();
    // insert video metada
    // pass in `self` as the delegate
    MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer.monitorJWPlayerController(player!, name: playName, delegate: self, playerData: playerData!, videoData: videoData)
    player!.play()
}

// example of implementing a delegate method
func onReady(_ event: JWEvent & JWReadyEvent) {
  // this will get called when JWPlayer triggers onPlay
}
```


The only required field is env_key. But without some more metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Metadata fields are provided via the MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData and MUXSDKCustomerVideoData` objects.

```swift
let playName = "iOS AVPlayer"
let playerData = MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData(environmentKey: "ENV_KEY");
playerData.viewerUserId = "1234"
playerData.experimentName = "player_test_A"
// note that the 'playerName' field here is unrelated to the 'playName' variable above
playerData.playerName = "My Main Player"
playerData.playerVersion = "1.0.0"

let videoData = MUXSDKCustomerVideoData();
videoData.videoId = "abcd123"
videoData.videoTitle = "My Great Video"
videoData.videoSeries = "Weekly Great Videos"
videoData.videoDuration = 120000 // in milliseconds
videoData.videoIsLive = false
videoData.videoCdn = "cdn"

MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer.monitorJWPlayerController(player!, name: playName, delegate: self, playerData: playerData!, videoData: videoData)
```
