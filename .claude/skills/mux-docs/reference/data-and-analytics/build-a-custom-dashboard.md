What are Custom Dashboards?

Custom dashboards provide a centralized view of your video performance data through configurable components. You can create dashboards with multiple visualization types, apply filters, and customize time periods to focus on specific aspects of your video performance.

Key features:

 Four component types: Timeseries, Bar charts, Lists, and Metric numbers
 10 components per Dashboard
 Dashboard and component-level filtering
 Flexible time period selection
 Comparison intervals
 Dashboard sharing and duplication

Custom Dashboards are available on Mux Data Media plans. Learn more about Mux Data Plans or contact support.

Creating a Dashboard

To create a new custom dashboard:

1. Navigate to the Dashboards section in Mux Data
2. Select Create Dashboard from the left menu or main window
3. Enter a descriptive name for your dashboard
4. Select Create Dashboard

Your new dashboard will be created and ready for customization with components and filters.

Dashboard Configuration

Time Periods

Configure the time period for your entire dashboard to focus on specific date ranges:

 Default: Last 24 hours
 Relative periods: Choose from predefined options like last 7 days or last 30 days
 Specific periods: Set exact start and end dates for consistent historical analysis

Time period changes apply to all dashboard components. Save your dashboard to preserve time period settings.

Custom Dashboards are currently only available for the standard 100 days of data. Long-term Metrics are not yet available with Custom Dashboards.

Dashboard Filters

Dashboard filters apply to all components within the dashboard providing consistent data filtering across visualizations.

Dimension Filters

Filter by dimension values such as country, operating system, or player version:

1. Select the Filter Dimensions button
2. Search for and select the dimension type
3. Choose specific values to include or exclude
4. Multiple values use OR logic (e.g., selecting iOS and Android shows views from either platform)

<Image

  width={2420}
  height={1164}
/>

Metric Filters

Filter by metric values to focus on specific performance thresholds:

1. Select the Filter Metrics button
2. Choose a metric (e.g., rebuffering percentage)
3. Select an operator (≤, ≥, \=, etc.)
4. Set the value threshold

<Image

  width={1264}
  height={500}
  caption="Example: Filter for views with rebuffering percentage ≤ 5% to focus on high-quality playback experiences."
/>

Filter changes can be previewed without saving. Click Save at the bottom of the dashboard to apply filters permanently.

Component Filters

Components can have their own filters in addition to Dashboard filters. Dashboard filters act as parent filters affecting all components. Component level filters are additive to Dashboard filters but only apply to the component.

If dashboard and component filters conflict, the component may show no data. Ensure filter combinations are logical and compatible.

Dashboard Components

Components visualize individual metrics within your dashboard. Each component type serves different analytical purposes and can be customized with specific filters and options.

1. To add a Dashboard component to a new Dashboard, select the Create Component button.
2. To add a Dashboard component to an existing Dashboard, select the Edit Icon next to the date selector.

Metric Numbers

Display key performance indicators in a prominent metrics bar at the top of your dashboard. Up to 5 Metric numbers can be added per dashboard. Metric numbers (up to 5\) collectively count as 1 component.

  width={1999}
  height={554}
/>

Configuration:

1. Select Metric Number as the component type
2. Choose the metric to display
3. Provide a descriptive name (50 character limit)
4. Optional: Add a comparison time period to show rate of change
5. Optional: Apply component-specific dimension or metric filters

Metric number components appear in creation order and cannot be reordered.

Timeseries

  width={1134}
  height={832}
/>

Track metrics over time to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in your video performance.

Configuration:

1. Select Timeseries as the component type
2. Choose the metric to chart over time
3. Set a descriptive component name
4. Select component size (half or full width)
5. Optional: Choose either:
     Comparison interval: Compare current period with a previous timeframe
     Breakdown values: Chart multiple values for a single dimension type (e.g., different device types)
6. Optional: Apply component-specific filters

Comparison intervals and breakdown values are mutually exclusive options. Also note that breakdown dimensions will take priority over dashboard and component filters of the same dimension.

Bars

  width={1134}
  height={834}
/>

Compare performance across different dimension values using horizontal bars.

Configuration:

1. Select Bars as the component type
2. Choose the metric to measure in the bars visualization
3. Select component size (half or full width)
4. Choose breakdown dimension type and values that you wish to display
5. Optional: Add a comparison interval to compare current period with a previous timeframe
6. Optional: Apply component-specific filters

Breakdown values must come from a single dimension category.

Lists

Rank and organize data to quickly identify top performers or problem areas.

<Image

  width={1190}
  height={770}
/>

Configuration:

1. Select List as the component type
2. Choose the metric to measure for each list item
3. Select the dimension to list (e.g., player names, video titles)
4. Set sort order (ascending or descending)
5. Specify the number of items to display in the list component
6. Provide a descriptive component name
7. Optional: Add a comparison interval
8. Optional: Apply component-specific filters

Lists are only available in half-width size.

Dashboard Management

Sharing Dashboards

When creating a new dashboard, you can choose to share it with everyone in your environment. Public dashboards appear in the Shared folder for all users in your environment. You can change the sharing level at any time from the More Options dropdown.

All users can view public dashboards. To save an editable version of a public dashboard, create a duplicate (see below).

Sharing via Dashboard Link

Any dashboard can be shared with users who have access to your Mux environment via the dashboard link, even if it's not marked as public. Users who receive a link can:

- View the dashboard
- Favorite it to save it to their personal list
- Create a duplicate to make their own editable copy (see below)

Editing Dashboard Permissions

Users have the ability to edit dashboards they are the owner of but do not have the ability to edit public dashboards they do not own. Admins have full editing abilities for all dashboards.

Advanced role-based permissions are coming soon.

Favoriting Dashboards

Favorite personal or shared dashboards to allow quick access to your most frequently used dashboards. You can have up to 20 favorited dashboards across your environments.

Favorite a dashboard by pressing the favoriting star in the dashboard menu. When a dashboard is favorited, the star will be highlighted and the dashboard will be added to the top of the custom dashboard navigation sidebar in the favorites section.

Saving Dashboard Copies

Save a modified version without affecting the original:

1. Make your desired changes to the dashboard
2. Use the Save As option in the save menu
3. Provide a new name for the copy

<Image

Exporting Dashboards

Export a dashboard to a PDF to save a snapshot of your dashboard:

1. Select the More Options menu (⋯) next to the favorite button
2. Choose Export PDF

<Image

  height={364}
/>

Duplicating Dashboards

Create an exact copy of an existing dashboard:

1. Select the More Options menu (⋯) next to the favorite button
2. Choose Duplicate

Duplication is not available while a dashboard is being edited.

Deleting Dashboards

Permanently remove dashboards you no longer need:

1. Select the More Options menu (⋯) next to the favorite button
2. Choose Delete
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleting a dashboard removes it for all users. Duplicate dashboards are not affected.

Dashboard Navigation

Exploring Metric Details

Access detailed metric analysis directly from dashboard components:

1. Select the Go To Metrics icon on any component
2. The metrics page opens with:
     Selected filters from your dashboard applied
    * The component's metric pre-selected
