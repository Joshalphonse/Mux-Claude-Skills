# Monitor THEOplayer (iOS)

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/monitor-theoplayer-ios

Requirements:

 THEOplayer.xcframework SDK for iOS (> 5.9)
 A working implementation of THEOplayer in your iOS app

Before integrating Mux-Stats-THEOplayer into your player, first make sure your THEOplayer implementation is working as expected.

Add Mux-Stats-THEOplayer to your podfile


```
pod 'Mux-Stats-THEOplayer', '~> 0.8'
```


Run pod install then import MuxCore and MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer modules into your application. Call monitorTHEOplayer and pass in a reference to your THEOplayer instance.

Below is an example configuration for a simple THEOplayer implementation. The key part to pay attention to is monitorTHEOplayer. This example is using ads with THEOplayer, which will also be tracked with Mux Data.


```swift
import MuxCore
import MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer
import THEOplayerSDK
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    let playerName = "demoplayer"
    var player: THEOplayer!

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        self.player = THEOplayer(configuration: THEOplayerConfiguration(chromeless: false))
        self.player.frame = view.bounds
        self.player.addAsSubview(of: view)

        let typedSource = TypedSource(
            src: "https://stream.mux.com/tqe4KzdxU6GLc8oowshXgm019ibzhEX3k.m3u8",
            type: "application/vnd.apple.mpegurl")

        let ad = THEOAdDescription(src: "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/124319096/external/ad_rule_samples&ciu_szs=300x250&ad_rule=1&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vmap&unviewed_position_start=1&cust_params=deployment%3Ddevsite%26sample_ar%3Dpremidpostpod&cmsid=496&vid=short_onecue&correlator=")

        let source = SourceDescription(source: typedSource, ads: [ad], textTracks: nil, poster: nil, analytics: nil, metadata: nil)
        self.player.source = source

        // TODO: Add your env key
        let playerData = MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData(environmentKey: "ENV_KEY")!

        let videoData = MUXSDKCustomerVideoData()
        videoData.videoTitle = "Big Buck Bunny"
        videoData.videoId = "bigbuckbunny"
        videoData.videoSeries = "animation"

        MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer.monitorTHEOplayer(self.player, name: playerName, playerData: playerData, videoData: videoData, softwareVersion: "1.1.1")
        self.player.play()
    }
}
```


The only required field is env_key. But without some more metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Metadata fields are provided via the MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData and MUXSDKCustomerVideoData objects.

For the full list of properties view the header files for this interfaces:

- MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData.h
- MUXSDKCustomerVideoData.h

For more details about each property, view the Make your data actionable guide.


```swift
let playName = "iOS AVPlayer"
let playerData = MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData(environmentKey: "ENV_KEY");
playerData.viewerUserId = "1234"
playerData.experimentName = "player_test_A"
// note that the 'playerName' field here is unrelated to the 'playName' variable above
playerData.playerName = "My Main Player"
playerData.playerVersion = "1.0.0"

let videoData = MUXSDKCustomerVideoData();
videoData.videoId = "abcd123"
videoData.videoTitle = "My Great Video"
videoData.videoSeries = "Weekly Great Videos"
videoData.videoDuration = 120000 // in milliseconds
videoData.videoIsLive = false
videoData.videoCdn = "cdn"


MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer.monitorTHEOplayer(self.player, name: playerName, playerData: playerData, videoData: videoData, softwareVersion: "1.1.1")
self.player.play()
```


Changing the video
If you want to change the video in the player, you'll need to let the Mux SDK know by calling videoChangeForPlayer. From the perspective of Mux Data, this will create a new view.


```swift
let videoData = MUXSDKCustomerVideoData()
videoData.videoTitle = "New Video"
videoData.videoId = "newVideoId"
MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer.videoChangeForPlayer(name: self.playerName, videoData: videoData)

let typedSource = TypedSource(src: "https://stream.mux.com/tNrV028WTqCOa02zsveBdNwouzgZTbWx5x.m3u8", type: "application/vnd.apple.mpegurl")
let source = SourceDescription(source: typedSource, ads: [], textTracks: nil, poster: nil, analytics: nil, metadata: nil)
self.player.source = source
self.player.play()
```


Handling Errors manually

By default, automaticErrorTracking is enabled which means the Mux SDK will catch errors that the player throws and track an error event. Error tracking is meant for fatal errors. When an error is thrown it will mark the view as having encountered an error in the Mux dashboard and the view will no longer be monitored.

If you want to disable automatic and track errors manually you can do by passing in automaticErrorTracking false when calling monitorTHEOplayer

Whether automatic error tracking is enabled or disabled, you can dispatch errors manually with dispatchError.


```swift
MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer.monitorTHEOplayer(self.player, name: playerName, playerData: playerData, videoData: videoData, softwareVersion: "1.1.1", automaticErrorTracking: false)
MUXSDKStatsTHEOplayer.dispatchError(name: playerName, code: "1234", message: "Something is not right")
```
