# Integrate Mux Uploader into your web application

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/uploader-web-integrate-in-your-webapp

Install Mux Uploader

Both are built with TypeScript and can be installed either via npm, yarn or the hosted option on jsdelivr.

npm install @mux/mux-uploader@latest #or @mux/mux-uploader-react@latest
```


Yarn


```shell
yarn add @mux/mux-uploader@latest #or @mux/mux-uploader-react@latest
```

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mux/mux-uploader"></script>
<!--
or src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mux/mux-uploader-react"
-->
```


Providing attributes

The only required value to use Mux uploader is endpoint.

Examples

HTML element

Using in HTML just requires adding the hosted ` tag to your page and then adding the ` element where you need it.

React

For our React implementation, you can use it just like you would any other React component.

Svelte

Because Svelte supports web components, it doesn't need a separate wrapper component like React. View the SveltKit example in the
Mux Elements repo for a fully functioning example.


```html
<script context="module" lang="ts">
  export const prerender = true;
</script>

<script lang="ts">
  // this prevents the custom elements from being redefined when the REPL is updated and reloads, which throws an error
  // this means that any changes to the custom element won't be picked up without saving and refreshing the REPL
  // const oldRegister = customElements.define;
  // customElements.define = function(name, constructor, options) {
  // 	if (!customElements.get(name)) {
  // 		oldRegister(name, constructor, options);
  // 	}
  // }
  // import { page } from '$app/stores';
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  onMount(async () => {
    await import("@mux/mux-uploader");
  });
</script>

<mux-uploader endpoint="https://httpbin.org/put" />
```


Vue

Because Vue supports web components, it doesn't need a separate wrapper component like React. View the Vue example in the Mux Elements repo for a fully functioning example.


```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import "@mux/mux-uploader";
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <mux-uploader endpoint="https://httpbin.org/put" />
  </main>
</template>
```
