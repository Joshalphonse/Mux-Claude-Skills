# Compose custom UIs with subcomponents

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/uploader-web-use-subcomponents-directly

Although Mux Uploader is a single component that's easy to drop into your web application, it's actually built using several subcomponents
"under the hood." If your application design or desired user experience requires more customization, you can use the individual web components that come packaged with Mux Uploader to build out a custom upload UI that meets your needs.

To use this approach, add an id attribute to your ` element with a unique value.

You can then associate the  element with any of the packaged components by adding a mux-uploader="" attribute to each component and setting it to the id that you gave to the  element.

Here's a simple example for the web component:


```html
<!-- add a mux-uploader tag with an id attribute and hide it with CSS -->
<mux-uploader id="my-uploader" style="display: none;"></mux-uploader>

<!-- ...then, somewhere else in your app, add a reference back to it -->
<mux-uploader-file-select mux-uploader="my-uploader">
  <button slot="file-select">Pick a video</button>
</mux-uploader-file-select>
```


Here's one for React:


```jsx
import MuxUploader, { MuxUploaderFileSelect } from "@mux/mux-uploader-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MuxUploader id="my-uploader" style={{ display: "none"}} />

    {/* ...then, somewhere else in your app, add a reference back to it */}
    <MuxUploaderFileSelect mux-uploader="my-uploader">
      <button slot="file-select">Pick a video</button>
    </mux-uploader-file-select>
  );
}
```


Because all of these are web components, you can use CSS to style them or
any of their slotted children (discussed below).

Subcomponents

File Select

The file select subcomponent is what tells Mux Uploader to open the file selection browser. The web component is
, and the React component is .

You can further customize it by slotting in your own  or other component in the file-select slot.

Here's an example:

Drop

The drop subcomponent is what implements the drag and drop API
and tells Mux Uploader the relevant details about the file.
The web component is , and the React component is .

Mux Uploader Drop provides a few slots for customization.

- heading - By default this is a  with the text "Drop a video file here to upload".
- separator - By default this is a  containing the text "or" placed between the heading and any additional children.
- (default) - Any additional children that don't have a specified slot will show up below the two previous slots.

Here's an example that puts all of these together, including CSS:

In addition, Mux Uploader Drop has attributes/properties for optionally showing an overlay whenever a file is
dragged over it. These are on by default in Mux Uploader, and are:

- overlay - A boolean attribute / property / React prop for enabling the overlay UI.
- overlay-text (overlayText property and React prop) - Allows you to provide custom text to show on the overlay.

If you'd like to further customize the overlay with a different background color, you can use the
--overlay-background-color CSS variable (which is also available when using Mux Uploader directly)

Here's an example of these in action:

Custom Drop
You can even implement your own drag and drop completely separate from  and as long as you dispatch a custom file-ready with the file in the detail property then  will handle the upload upon receiving the event.


```html
<script>
  const muxUploader = document.querySelector("mux-uploader");

  // Dispatch custom event to trigger upload
  muxUploader.dispatchEvent(
    new CustomEvent("file-ready", {
      composed: true,
      bubbles: true,
      detail: file,
    })
  );
</script>
```


Progress

The progress subcomponent is what visualizes progress of your upload. In fact, it is used twice "under the hood" by the default :
once for showing the %, and once for showing the progress bar.
The web component is , and the React component is .

In addition, Mux Uploader Progress exposes the type attribute / property / React prop for choosing the particular kind of visualization you'd prefer. The
available type values are:

- percentage (default) - Show as a numeric % in text
- bar - Show as a progress bar
- radial (_Experimental_) - Show as a radial/circular progress indicator

Each of these types also has CSS variables available for further customization:

percentage:

- --progress-percentage-display - Applies to the display of the underlying percentage element (default: block).

bar:

- --progress-bar-height - Applies to the height of the progress bar (default: 4px).
- --progress-bar-fill-color - Applies to the color of the progress bar's progress indication (default: black).

radial:

- --progress-radial-fill-color - Applies to the color of the radial progress indication (default: black).

Here's an example of these in action:

Status

The status subcomponent is what indicates when the upload is completed, or an error has occurred, or when you're offline.
The web component is , and the React component is .

Here's an example with a bit of CSS customization, using Mux Uploader's state attributes
on the status component for additional state-driven styling:

Retry

The retry subcomponent that is displayed when an error has occurred to retry uploading and will notify Mux Uploader to retry when clicked.
The web component is , and the React component is .

Here's a simple example:

Pause

The pause subcomponent that is displayed while an upload is in progress and will notify Mux Uploader to either pause or resume uploading
when clicked, depending on the current uploading state.
The web component is , and the React component is `.

Here's a simple example:

Advanced use cases

Here are some more examples of working with the subcomponents directly, using multiple subcomponents together to demonstrate the versatility
and composability of using the various subcomponents together in either React or vanilla HTML.

React CSS modules

Just like you can do with the "batteries" usage of Mux Uploader, you can use CSS-in-JS
to handle styling of your subcomponents in React. Here's an example of how you can style Mux Uploader using CSS modules:

React Tailwind CSS

Also like Mux Uploader, you can use Tailwind CSS for your subcomponent styling. Here's an example in React:

Uploader Page

In this example, we use the Mux Uploader Drop component as the parent for a full page upload experience, with the various subcomponents as descendants
with their own customization for a more bespoke look and feel:
