# Guide to writing guides

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/example

Clone the repo muxinc/docs.mux.com. Follow instructions in the README to get the project runnig locally. After you have it running, you're ready to create a new guide.

To add a new guide, add an .mdx file /docs/_guides folder. You might find it handy to copy this file (docs/_guides/example.mdx) to the file you want to create.

Next, add the guide to the sidebar. The sidebar sections are defined in the docs/_config folder.

Any guide that is not in the sidebar will not display (unless it has its own file in the /app directory -- see spaces-to-livekit for example)

Create all your changes on a branch and submit a pull request. Vercel will build a deploy preview for your branch for easy sharing.

Wait, what's an .mdx file?
Guides are written in MDX, meaning you can write in Markdown, and you can include shiny components.

We'll talk more about the shiny components in the rest of the guide. But first, some quick markdown pointers.

_text written like this:_

```md
Paragraphs are written in normal text like this.
Use two line breaks to start a new paragraph.

Use [markdown link syntax](https://www.mux.com).
Normal markdown syntax like **bold** and _italic_, ordered lists and unordered lists should all work as expected.
```

Writing well

Guides should be a holistic story around a problem a customer is trying to solve instead of just our features.

Use the instructions in the image below, coupled with The Writing/voice guideline in notion so that our guides have a consistent tone.

You should write good, descriptive headers. They're useful for users who are navigating your guide using the table of contents, and it's useful for search engines.

In some cases, though, the table of contents might not be enough. For example, if you have a guide that has a few, clear, discrete steps that are worth highlighting up front. In these cases, we use the steps frontmatter and the ` component.

> This example guide uses steps and , if you're curious for an example

To use steps and , begin by defining steps in the frontmatter. For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - title: 1. Add a guide to /docs/_guides
  - title: 2. Write a guide
  - title: Decide whether to use `steps`
    description: You should use good headers in your guide. In some situations, you may want to define those headers with the `<LinkedHeader />` component instead of markdown.
  - title: Create code examples
    topic: code
```

Notice three things about these steps:
1. if you begin a step with a number, that number will be used in the steps' icon
2. your step may optionally have a description
3. your step my optionally have a custom icon. These icons are defined in docs/_components/guide-icons

Once your steps are defined in your frontmatter, you're ready to add them as a header. Add a  component in your document where you want the header to appear. Reference the step like this:  or .

Linked headers will render as an .

If your header has a specific API reference associated with it you can pass in a prop for apiRef like this:


```jsx
<LinkedHeader
  step={steps[2]}
  apiRef={{ product: "video", slug: "create-an-asset" }}
/>
```


All embedded Video Walkthroughs will reference videos with subtitles that exist in the docs environment under the organization named "Mux Marketing Videos". You can add Video walkthrough videos to the docs environment by using the script create-video-walkthrough.js. To add new video walkthroughs to any .mdx file you first must add videos to this Mux environment, then add a reference to their playback ID to the guide header inside GuideVideoWalkthrough element.

If the video file does not have captions/text track already in it, that here are the steps you'll want to take to generate the video with captions (for accessibility):

1. Get the public video file url for the raw video in [Dropbox > Mux > DevEx > Video Production > Renders (Release)]().

This process is moving away from Dropbox into Google Drive soon.

2. Log in to the Mux Marketing Videos organization with an admin account and navigate to dashboard.mux.com to view all assets in the docs environment. If you don't have access to this organization, please request access by posting in the devex-dev channel in Slack.

3. Upload your new video, but modify the API request so that it includes autogenerated_subtitles like so:


```
{
  "inputs": [{
    "url": "https://your_public_url",
    "generated_subtitles": [{
      "language_code": "en",
      "name": "default"
    }]
  }],
  "playback_policies": [
    "public"
  ],
  "max_resolution_tier": "2160p"
}
```


4. Get the PlaybackId from your new asset. In the Title / header section between "---" lines, of any .mdx guide, add the asset's Playback Id to src and thumbnailTime: 25:


```
videoWalkthrough:
  src: 01b2r4H6Pg8Q01NJZGppCu6X6tmfP6f6Jtp5oFZaETUwU
  thumbnailTime: 25
```


6. Test video for usability

Inline

For inline code use backticks like this.

Code Blocks

Language

For blocks of code you can use triple backticks like this and specify the language.

Here is a block of JSON code:


```json
{
  "id": "123456"
}
```


Here is a block of JavaScript code:


```js
import Mux from "@mux/mux-node";
```


Code block props
You can also pass the following props to code blocks:
- filename=file.js
- withLineNumbers=true/false
- highlight=1,3-5: blue highlight
- add=1,3-5: green highlight (will replace line number with +)
- remove=1,3-5: red highlight (will replace line number with -)
- warning=1,3-5: yellow highlight
- error=1,3-5: red highlight

For example...

```
```
js filename=file.js withLineNumbers=false highlight=1,3-5

```
will render...
```
js filename=file.js withLineNumbers=false highlight=1,3-5
<Image
  src="/docs/images/settings-access-token-env.png"
  width={1140}
  height={374}
  alt="Mux access token env"
/>

```

#### Transformer comments
You can also achieve some of the code block arguments with inline transformer comments. Whether you use code block arguments or transformer comments is up to you! Place the following in an inline comment to transform the line:
- `[!code highlight]`: blue highlight
- `[!code ++]`: green highlight (will replace line number with `+`)
- `[!code --]`: red highlight (will replace line number with `-`)
- `[!code error]`: yellow highlight
- `[!code warning]`: red highlight

For example...

```
text withLineNumbers=false

```js
// next.config.js
const { withNextVideo } = require('next-video/process') // [!code ++]

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {}

module.exports = withNextVideo(nextConfig, { // [!code ++]
  provider: 'vercel-blob', // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]
```


...will render...


```js
// next.config.js
const { withNextVideo } = require('next-video/process') // [!code ++]

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {}

module.exports = withNextVideo(nextConfig, { // [!code ++]
  provider: 'vercel-blob', // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]
```


This works in any language that supports inline comments. For example...

```html
<p>highlight</p> <!-- [!code highlight] -->
```


```elixir
IO.puts("highlight") # [!code highlight]
```


Multiple Languages

This is an example of a complex code example that shows code from multiple languages.

Take a look at the code_examples/video/example.js file to see all the code snippets in there.

After creating that file and adding the code snippets in various languages, that file is imported into code_examples/index.ts. Once it is imported to there it can be used with the  component. You can re-order the languages in the example by using the exampleOrder attribute as a comma-separated list of languages. Finally,  by exporting a args object from the example file, you can use code block arguments like filename and highlight. You can also use the displayName argument to override what the example is named in the tabs, and lang to override what language is used to highlight the example.


```jsx
<CodeExamples product="video" example="example" exampleOrder="go,php,python" />
```


Interactive Code Examples

Similar to multi-language code examples, interactive code examples are defined in the code_examples directory and imported in code_examples/index.ts. Interactive code examples can have the following exports:

- options (default: {})
- template (default: vanilla)
- files (default: {})
- customSetup (default {})

> See code_examples/video-interactive/example.ts for an example

Once imported, interactive examples can be used with the  component.


```jsx
<InteractiveCodeExample product="video" example="example" />
```


First, add an image into the public/images directory. And then use the  component. Be sure to pass in the width, height and alt properties.

The width and height should be the natural dimensions of the source image. You can find this by the dimensions of the image on the filesystem. Our  component (next/image) will detect the aspect ratio and the container that the image is being rendered into and optimize the size automatically so you don't need to worry about optimizing the image ahead of time. Our  component will also make sure there is no layout shift when the page loads so you don't see any kind of awkward content shift on the initial load.

You can also include a caption prop. If you provide a caption it will be rendered below the image in italics and if the alt prop is omitted then the caption will be used as the alt.

For example, this code produces the image below


```jsx
<Image
  src="/docs/images/settings-access-token-env.png"
  width={1140}
  height={374}
  alt="Mux access token env"
/>
```


<Image
  src="/docs/images/settings-access-token-env.png"
  width={1140}
  height={374}
  alt="Mux access token env"
/>

By default images will stretch the full width, but sometimes that's too big, so you can constrain them to be small with the sm property with code like this. This works well for vertical images.


```jsx
<Image
  sm
  src="/docs/images/iOS-quality-options.png"
  width={750}
  height={1334}
  caption="iOS video app with video quality options"
/>
```


<Image
  sm
  src="/docs/images/iOS-quality-options.png"
  width={750}
  height={1334}
  caption="iOS video app with video quality options"
/>

The  component is used to highlight key pieces of information. It comes in 4 flavors:

- info is used for informational kind of things. When something is "good to know" but no necessarily critical or dangerous.
- warning is used for things that area "gotcha". Or something that might non-obvious or easy to overlook.
- error is one level up from warning. This is something mission-critical that would result in an error or a potential security issue if it is overlooked.
- success is a happy callout. A common case for this is when we want to lead the developer down a default path if they are unsure of something. For example "Most applications use X. If you're unsure if you should use option A or option B, you probably want option A."


```jsx
<Callout type="info">This is an example of an info callout</Callout>
```


This is an example of an info callout

Using type="warning" looks like this:

This is an example of warning callout

Using type="error" looks like this:

The error callout looks a little more scary.

You can have multiple paragraphs

And things like lists:

- one
- two
- three

Markdown
You can optionally write markdown inside the callout. This is an example of adding a header to a type="success" callout.


```jsx
<Callout type="success">
  **Hi, I'm bold!**
</Callout>
```


And that will render the following:

  Hi, I'm bold!

Titles

You can optionally give a callout a title. That looks like this.


```jsx
<Callout type="success" title="What a `title`">
  A callout with a title
</Callout>
```


And that will render the following:

  A callout with a title

Use the  component as a wrapper and add up to 3  components as children.

  <GuideCard
    title="Configure Playback"
    description="Set up your iOS application, Android application or web application to start playing your Mux assets"
    links={[
      { title: "Web", href: "/docs/guides/play-your-videos" },
      { title: "iOS", href: "/docs/guides/play-your-videos" },
      { title: "Android", href: "/docs/guides/play-your-videos" },
    ]}
  />
  <GuideCard
    title="Preview your video"
    description="Now that you have Mux assets, build rich experiences into your application by previewing your videos with Thumbnails and Storyboards"
  />
  <GuideCard
    title="Integrate Mux Data"
    description="Add the Mux Data SDK to your player and start collecting playback performance metrics."
  />

Add multiple images in one place with . Define your images by passing them to the images prop:


```mdx
<MultiImage
  images={[
    { src: "/docs/images/blurup-loading.png", width: 409, height: 230 },
    { src: "/docs/images/blurup-loaded.png", width: 409, height: 227 },
  ]}
/>
```


We are a video company, are we not? If your video describes your whole guide, use videoWalkthrough in your frontmatter. If you just need something inline?  is your guy.

It takes all the normal Mux Player React props, as well as caption and sm (as described above for ).

Link to API References with
If you have an inline-link to an API reference use  component like this link to assets.

Reuse snippets with
Got some text you're using over and over across multiple guides you maintain? Use  instead!

Start by adding a snippet to guides/snippets. Then, import it in config/snippets. Finally:

```mdx
<MdxImport snippet="yourSnippetName" />
```


Currently, our table of contents can't "see" into snippets. This is something I wanna fix but it's a hairy problem, so... um... sorry about that.

Declutter search and the TOC with

We often have these loooooooong changelogs at the ends of some of our guides. (Idk why we're not just using the docs changelog for those, but, I'm sure someone has a good explanation.)

We wrap these long changelogs in a  tag. That tag tells
1. search to deprioritize these sections
2. the table of contents to not include these sections

And more

Let's be honest. I probably forgot to update these docs with the latest component. See other guides for examples of components in action. And take a look at components/mdx` for a full list of components supported in our guiesguides.
