# Monitor Flowplayer

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/monitor-flowplayer

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: npm install --save @mux/mux-data-flowplayer,
    yarn: yarn add @mux/mux-data-flowplayer,
    cdn:

  }}
  exampleOrder="npm,yarn,cdn"
/>

Call flowplayer like you normally would and save a reference to the player. Call initFlowplayerMux with the player reference.

Passing in flowplayer global

You'll see the 3rd argument to initFlowplayerMux is flowplayer. This is the global flowplayer object. If you are using a bundler and importing flowplayer with require or import then you'll need to pass in the flowplayer object.

If no flowplayer object is passed in, then initFlowplayerMux will look for flowplayer on then global window object.

The only required field in the options that you pass into @mux/mux-data-flowplayer is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data on initialization.


```js
initFlowplayerMux(player, container, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000, can use `initFlowplayerMux.utils.now()`
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```


For more information, view Make your data actionable.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call initFlowplayerMux. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
player.mux.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source


```js
// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
player.mux.emit('videochange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
player.mux.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
initFlowplayerMux(player, container, {
  debug: false,
  disableCookies: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
initFlowplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  respectDoNotTrack: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-flowplayer will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
player.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: translateContext(error.player_error_context)
  };
}

// player is the instance that gets returned from the `flowplayer` function
initFlowplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
initFlowplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Ads tracking with @mux/mux-data-flowplayer

Mux has been tested with and support Flowplayer's IMA and VAST plugins for ad support. No addition configuration is needed, Mux will track ads automatically.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
initFlowplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```
