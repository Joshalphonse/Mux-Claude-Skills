v5.5.0

- Update mechanism for generating unique IDs, used for view_id and others
- Use crypto.randomUUID(), when available, for generating UUID values

v5.4.3

- [chore] internal build process fix (no functional changes)

v5.4.2

- feat(google-ima): Beta implementation of google-ima extension to mux-embed
- feat(mux-embed): Add methods for post-initialization overrides of functionality (for internal use only).
- fix(mux-embed): typecheck for dashjs.getSource is incorrect.

v5.4.1

- Expose updateData globally and fix types
- Fix an issue where views were not ended cleanly on long resume detection

v5.4.0

- Add updateData function that allows Mux Data metadata to be updated mid-view.

v5.3.3

- expose HEARTBEAT and DESTROY under mux.events

v5.3.2

- Fix type issues for error severity and business exception

v5.3.1

- fix(mux-embed): Remove 3rd party dependencies and replace with appropriately equivalent functionality.

v5.3.0

- Ignore request events when emitting heartbeat events

v5.2.0

- Bug fix to not de-dupe error event metadata
- Extend errorTranslator to work with player_error_severity and player_error_business_exception

v5.1.0

- Target ES5 for bundles and validate bundles are ES5

- fix an issue where seeking time before first play attempt counted towards video startup time

v5.0.0

- Add opt-in TypeScript Types to Mux Embed and use + refactor for other dependent data SDKs. Update published dists to include CJS and ESM.
- Mux Embed now provides (opt in) TypeScript types in its published package, as well as publishes CJS and ESM versions of the package.
- This allows us to provide a lower risk and iterative roll out of official TypeScript types for mux-embed. The export types updates were required to ensure actual matches between the dist package and corresponding TypeScript types.
- This _should_ have no direct impact on users, though different build tools will now potentially select one of the new export types (e.g. the ESM "flavor" of mux-embed). TypeScript types _should not_ be applied unless they are explicitly referenced in app (discussed in docs updates).

v4.30.0

- fix an issue causing certain network metrics to not be available for dashjs v4.x

- fix an issue where certain IDs used may cause a DOM exception to be raised

v4.29.0

- fix(mux-embed): avoid using element id for muxId. attach muxId to element.

v4.28.1

- fix an issue where beaconDomain deprecation line was incorrectly logged

v4.28.0

- Deprecate beaconDomain in favor of beaconCollectionDomain. The beaconDomain setting will continue to function, but integrations should change to beaconCollectionDomain instead.

v4.27.0

- Fix an issue where playback time was incorrectly counted during seeking and other startup activities
- Add events for the collection of ad clicks
- fix an issue where seek latency could be unexpectedly large
- fix an issue where seek latency does not include time at end of a view
- Add events for the collection of ad skips

v4.25.0

- Include ad watch time in playback time

v4.24.0

- Fix an issue where beacons over a certain size could get hung and not be sent

v4.23.0

- Fix an issue where tracking rebuffering can get into an infinite loop

- Update Headers type

v4.22.0
