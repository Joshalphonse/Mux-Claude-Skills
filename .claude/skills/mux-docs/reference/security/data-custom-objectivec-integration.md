# Custom Objective-C integration

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/data-custom-objectivec-integration

Mux has a pre-built integration with Apple's AVPlayer for iOS and tvOS applications; for these players, see here: iOS Integration Guide.

If the player that you use does not expose the AVPlayer instance directly, swaps between multiple instances during playback, or uses some other playback mechanism completely, a custom integration may be needed.

Important Related Docs
Before proceeding, read the following overview: Building a Custom Integration.

In addition, the source code for Mux's integration with Apple's AVPlayer is open source and can be found in the Mux-Stats-AVPlayer GitHub repository. This project is a good example of how to use the Objective-C core library in building a player integration.

Include the Mux-Core library

Installing in Xcode with Swift Package Manager

1. In your Xcode project click "File" > "Add Package"
2. In the top-right corner of the modal window paste in the SDK repository URL:


```
https://github.com/muxinc/stats-sdk-objc.git
```


3. Click Next.
4. Since the MuxCore follows SemVer, we recommend setting the "Rules" to install the latest version and choosing the option "Up to Next Major". Here's an overview of the different SPM Dependency Rules and their semantics.

Installing in Package.swift

Open your Package.swift file, add the following to dependencies:


```swift
    .package(
      url: "https://github.com/muxinc/stats-sdk-objc",
      .upToNextMajor(from: "5.0.1")
    ),
```


Installing with CocoaPods

To include the core Objective-C library via CocoaPods, modify your Podfile to use frameworks by including use_frameworks! and then add the following pod to your Podfile:


```ruby
pod "Mux-Stats-Core", "~> 5.0"
```


This will include our current release of the core Objective-C library. There will be no breaking updates within major versions of this library, so you can safely run pod update.

Since version 3, Mux-Stats-Core has been updated for Xcode 12 and XCFrameworks bundle type.

Including Manually (not preferred)

If you do not you use CocoaPods and wish to include the library manually, view the XCFramework directory in the Mux Objective-C Core SDK and dragging the framework into your Xcode project.

Initialize the SDK

There is no need to initialize a player monitor for each player that is being tracked, as this happens automatically when events are emitted for a specific player. For the Objective-C library, the Environment and Viewer-specific data should be emitted to the SDK globally as follows.


```objc
MUXSDKEnvironmentData *environmentData = [[MUXSDKEnvironmentData alloc] init];
[environmentData setMuxViewerId:[[[UIDevice currentDevice] identifierForVendor] UUIDString]];
MUXSDKViewerData *viewerData = [[MUXSDKViewerData alloc] init];
NSString *bundleId = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier];
if (bundleId) {
  [viewerData setViewerApplicationName:bundleId];
}
// Set additional Viewer data as above
MUXSDKDataEvent *dataEvent = [[MUXSDKDataEvent alloc] init];
[dataEvent setEnvironmentData:environmentData];
[dataEvent setViewerData:viewerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchGlobalDataEvent:dataEvent];
```


The only field that should be modified within MUXSDKEnvironmentData is the muxViewerId, via setMuxViewerId, which should be a device-specific string. This field is used within the Mux Dashboard as the Viewer ID in the case that a user-specific value is not provided in the metadata, via [MUXSDKCustomerViewerData setViewerUserId:].

If you are monitoring playback and delivery of Mux Video assets, you may opt-in to Mux Data inferring your environment details from player HTTP traffic. To opt-in, initialize MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData with environmentKey set to nil.

For MUXSDKViewerData, the fields that may be provided are the following.


```objc
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerApplicationEngine;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerApplicationName;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerApplicationVersion;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerConnectionType;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerDeviceCategory;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerDeviceManufacturer;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerDeviceName;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerOsArchitecture;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerOsFamily;
@property (nullable) NSString *viewerOsVersion;
```


See the AVPlayer integration for example values used.

Emit events

For the Objective-C core SDK, there are two types of events that should be emitted: data events and playback events. Data events are events that update metadata about the video or view, whereas playback events are those described here: Mux Playback Events.

All events are emitted to a specific Player, so make sure to include the unique player ID with each event emitted.

Data Events
Data events are emitted via [MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent: forPlayer:], and should be emitted when any of the following pieces of metadata change:

 - MUXSDKVideoData
  - videoSourceWidth - width of the video currently being played, in pixels
  - videoSourceHeight - height of the video currently being played, in pixels
  - videoSourceIsLive - whether the video currently being played is live or not
  - videoSourceDuration - the duration, in milliseconds, of the video currently being played
  - videoSourceAdvertisedBitrate - the bitrate of the current rendition being played, in bits per second
  - videoSourceFrameDrops - the total number of dropped video frames for the current View
 - Anything in MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData, as defined here: Metadata
 - Anything in MUXSDKCustomerVideoData, as defined here: Metadata
 - Anything in MUXSDKCustomerViewData, as defined here: Metadata

When any of the above fields change, do the following:
 - Create one or more instances of MUXSDKVideoData , MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData, MUXSDKCustomerVideoData, and MUXSDKCustomerViewData depending on what changed
 - Assign all properties with the most recent value via the helper methods to the appropriate instance of data
 - Attach these to an instance of MUXSDKDataEvent
 - Emit this MUXSDKDataEvent via [MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent: forPlayer:]

For example, when the resolution of the video being played back changes (such as in adaptive streaming), the following should be done:


```objc
"code": "// Prepare the data update\nMUXSDKVideoData *videoData = [[MUXSDKVideoData alloc] init];\n[videoData setVideoSourceWidth:[NSNumber numberWithInt:width]];\n[videoData setVideoSourceHeight:[NSNumber numberWithInt:height]];\n// put it within a MUXSDKDataEvent\nMUXSDKDataEvent *dataEvent = [[MUXSDKDataEvent alloc] init];\n[dataEvent setVideoData:videoData];\n// Emit the event\n[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:dataEvent forPlayer:_playerName];",
"language": "objectivec"
```


Playback Events
The Mux Playback Events should be emitted as the events are defined in the referenced document. With regards to naming, the names should align with those in the document, with the following changes: MUXSDK is appended in front of the name, the name itself should be PascalCased, and Event is appended at the end. For instance, for playerready, the corresponding event is MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent, as defined in MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent.h.

With each playback event that is emitted, the following fields within MUXSDKPlayerData should be included with the latest values:
 - playerMuxPluginName - The name of the integration being built, as a string
 - playerMuxPluginVersion - The version of the integration being built, as a string
 - playerSoftwareName - The name of the player software (e.g. AVPlayer, AVPlayerLayer, etc)
 - playerSoftwareLanguageCode - The language code (e.g. en-US) of the player UI localization
 - playerWidth - The width of the player, in logical pixels
 - playerHeight - The height of the player, in logical pixels
 - playerIsFullscreen - Boolean of whether the player is currently displayed in full screen or not
 - playerIsPaused- Boolean of whether the player is currently paused (i.e. not playing or trying to play)
 - playerPlayheadTime - The current playhead time of the player, in milliseconds

For instance, when emitting the MUXSDKPlayerReady event, it should look like the following:


```objc
// Get the player data
MUXSDKPlayerData *playerData = [[MUXSDKPlayerData alloc] init];
// Set the player data information
[playerData setPlayerMuxPluginName:@"Sample Custom Player"];
// ... repeat the above for all values within `MUXSDKPlayerData`
// Emit the event
MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent *event = [[MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent alloc] init];
[event setPlayerData:playerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:event forPlayer:_playerName];
```


In addition to the above data fields, for ad and network events there are additional data fields that should be sent. These are documented alongside the events described in Mux Playback Events, and follow similar naming conventions.

In particular:
 - Network throughput events should be emitted as MUXSDKRequestBandwidthEvents, with the addition of MUXSDKBandwidthMetricData set on the event via [MUXSDKRequestBandwidthEvent
 setBandwidthMetricData:].
 - If your player gives you access to your streams rendtion list, you can use the renditionLists property of MUXSDKBandwidthMetricData  track a stream's renditions with their resolution, framerate, bitrate, and RFC CODECS tag (ref).
 - Ad events are emitted via a special method, dispatchAdEvent, and details can be seen within Mux's IMA integration for AVPlayer

Lastly, for the MUXSDKRenditionChangeEvent, you should make sure to dispatch a MUXSDKDataEvent with the latest updated MUXSDKVideoData immediately before dispatching the MUXSDKRenditionChangeEvent.

Sample event sequence

There are multiple steps in setting up and tracking a view correctly. A very simple sequence of events to track a basic playback would look like the following steps:

1. Dispatch a global data event with the environment and viewer data
1. Dispatch the MUXSDKViewInitEvent with the current state of the player and video
1. Dispatch a MUXSDKDataEvent with the updated MUXSDKCustomerVideoData and MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData for the current video view
1. Dispatch the rest of the Mux Playback Events (e.g. MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent, MUXSDKPlayEvent, MUXSDKPlayingEvent, MUXSDKTimeUpdateEvent, etc), each time with the updated current state of the player

Note: For each Playback Event and MUXSDKViewInitEvent that is dispatched, the current state of the player and video data (MUXSDKPlayerData and MUXSDKVideoData should be attached to the event prior to dispatching the event.


```objc
// First, emit the global data event setting up the information about
// the player. This will likely only be called once within your application
// and does not need to be called for each player that is tracked.
MUXSDKDataEvent *dataEvent = [[MUXSDKDataEvent alloc] init];
[dataEvent setEnvironmentData:environmentData];
[dataEvent setViewerData:viewerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchGlobalDataEvent:_dataEvent];

// Prepare the view before you emit any other playback events
MUXSDKViewInitEvent *event = [[MUXSDKViewInitEvent alloc] init];
[event setPlayerData:playerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:event forPlayer:playerName];

// Dispatch data about the view itself.
// Note: customerPlayerData must include your environment key.
MUXSDKDataEvent *dataEvent = [[MUXSDKDataEvent alloc] init];
[dataEvent setCustomerPlayerData:customerPlayerData];
[dataEvent setCustomerVideoData:customerVideoData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:dataEvent forPlayer:_playerName];

// Emit playback events
MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent *event = [[MUXSDKPlayerReadyEvent alloc] init];
[event setPlayerData:playerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:event forPlayer:_playerName];

// When the player begins to attempt playback
MUXSDKPlayEvent *event = [[MUXSDKPlayEvent alloc] init];
[event setPlayerData:playerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:event forPlayer:_playerName];

// When the player actually displays first moving frame
MUXSDKPlayingEvent *event = [[MUXSDKPlayingEvent alloc] init];
[event setPlayerData:playerData];
[MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:event forPlayer:_playerName];

// ... and repeat for all of the playback events
```


Additional methods

Most of the events are signaled as listed above. However, there are a few cases of events that require additional work.

Changing the Video
In order to change the video within a player, there are a few events that need to be fired in sequence. You can see the implementation of this within the muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-avplayer code. You should do the following:
1. Dispatch a viewend event
2. Dispatch a viewinit event
3. Dispatch a MUXSDKDataEvent with the new video's MUXSDKCustomerVideoData, with the videoChange property set to YES.

If at various times the same underlying video stream needs to be monitoried as effectively separate videos and separate Data views, two additional events: play and playing need to be dispatched

See an example implementation of this in the muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-avplayer code.

The following are the required steps from start to finish:
1. As before, dispatch a viewend event
2. As before, dispatch a viewinit event
3. As before, dispatch a MUXSDKDataEvent with the new video's MUXSDKCustomerVideoData, with the videoChange property set to YES.
4. Dispatch a play event
5. Dispatch a playing event

Sending Error events
Your custom integration is able to dispatch error events associated with the current view. These errors can get alerted on and are also visually indicated on the event timeline shown for that view.

When dispatching errors your custom integration can provide additional error metadata with Error Categorization. This section will cover several examples of dispatching errors using the Objective-C SDK. You can find more general information on Error Categorization here.

Any error categories specified by your custom integration can be configured to be overridden based on the player error code. See the Error Categorization guide for more details.

This example dispatches an error event that Mux will categorize as a fatal playback error unless a different default for the player error code applies.


```objc
// Call this method from the source of the fatal playback error (such as an `AVPlayer` key-value property observer, for example) with parameters appropriate to your integration.
- (void)dispatchPlaybackWarningWithPlayerName:(NSString *)playerName
                              playerErrorCode:(NSString *)playerErrorCode
                           playerErrorMessage:(NSString *)playerErrorMessage
                           playerErrorContext:(NSString *)playerErrorContext
                           playerPlayheadTime:(NSNumber *)playerPlayheadTime {
  MUXSDKErrorEvent *errorEvent = [[MUXSDKErrorEvent alloc] initWithContext:playerErrorContext];

  // Configure any custom video or view data if necessary
  MUXSDKPlayerData *playerData = [[MUXSDKPlayerData alloc] init];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorCode:playerErrorCode];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorMessagae:playerErrorMessage];
  [playerData setPlayerPlayheadTime: playerPlayheadTime];
  // ... repeat for any other `MUXSDKPlayerData` properties if they've changed

  [MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:event
                forPlayer:playerName];
}
```


This example dispatches an error that Mux will categorize as a warning unless a different default for the player error code applies.


```objc
// Call this method from the source of the playback warning (such as an `AVPlayer` key-value property observer, for example) with parameters appropriate to your integration.
- (void)dispatchPlaybackWarningWithPlayerName:(NSString *)playerName
                              playerErrorCode:(NSString *)playerErrorCode
                           playerErrorMessage:(NSString *)playerErrorMessage
                           playerErrorContext:(NSString *)playerErrorContext
                           playerPlayheadTime:(NSNumber *)playerPlayheadTime {
  MUXSDKErrorEvent *errorEvent = [[MUXSDKErrorEvent alloc] initWithSeverity:MUXSDKErrorSeverityWarning
                                                                    context:playerErrorContext];

  // Configure any custom video or view data if necessary
  MUXSDKPlayerData *playerData = [[MUXSDKPlayerData alloc] init];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorCode:playerErrorCode];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorMessagae:playerErrorMessage];
  [playerData setPlayerPlayheadTime: playerPlayheadTime];
  // ... repeat for any other `MUXSDKPlayerData` properties if they've changed

  [MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:errorEvent
                  forPlayer:playerName];
}
```


This example dispatches an error that Mux will catgeorize as a business exception unless a different default for the player error code applies.

```objc
// Call this method from the source of the business exception with parameters appropriate to your integration.
- (void)dispatchBusinessExceptionWithPlayerName:(NSString *)playerName
                                  playerErrorCode:(NSString *)playerErrorCode
                                  playerErrorMessage:(NSString *)playerErrorMessage
                                  playerErrorContext:(NSString *)playerErrorContext
                                  playerPlayheadTime:(NSNumber *)playerPlayheadTime {

  // This method does not set an explicit error severity, see below for an example method that does.
  MUXSDKErrorEvent *errorEvent = [[MUXSDKErrorEvent alloc] initWithContext:playerErrorContext];
  [errorEvent setIsBusinessException: YES];

  // Configure any custom video or view data if necessary
  MUXSDKPlayerData *playerData = [[MUXSDKPlayerData alloc] init];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorCode:playerErrorCode];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorMessage:playerErrorMessage];
  [playerData setPlayerPlayheadTime:playerPlayheadTime];
  // ... repeat for any other `MUXSDKPlayerData` properties if they've changed

  [MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:errorEvent
                  forPlayer:playerName];
}

// Call this method from the source of the business exception with parameters appropriate to your integration.
- (void)dispatchBusinessExceptionWithPlayerName:(NSString *)playerName
                                  playerErrorSeverity:(MUXSDKErrorSeverity)errorSeverity
                                  playerErrorCode:(NSString *)playerErrorCode
                                  playerErrorMessage:(NSString *)playerErrorMessage
                                  playerErrorContext:(NSString *)playerErrorContext
                                  playerPlayheadTime:(NSNumber *)playerPlayheadTime {
  MUXSDKErrorEvent *errorEvent = [[MUXSDKErrorEvent alloc] initWithContext:playerErrorContext];
  [errorEvent setIsBusinessException: YES];

  // Configure any custom video or view data if necessary
  MUXSDKPlayerData *playerData = [[MUXSDKPlayerData alloc] init];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorCode:playerErrorCode];
  [playerData setPlayerErrorMessage:playerErrorMessage];
  [playerData setPlayerPlayheadTime:playerPlayheadTime];
  // ... repeat for any other `MUXSDKPlayerData` properties if they've changed

  [MUXSDKCore dispatchEvent:errorEvent
                  forPlayer:playerName];
}
```


Destroying the Monitor
When you are tearing down the player and want to stop monitoring it, make sure to remove any listeners that you have on the player for sending events to MUXSDKCore. After this, make sure to call [MUXSDKCore destroyPlayer: _name]; for the name of your player, so that the core library can clean up any monitoring and end the view session.

Release notes

Current release

v5.7.1

Fixes:
 Ensure playbackmodechange events are sent
 Restores tvOS-specific seeking detection behavior, where a best-effort attempt is made to count the preceding pause as part of the seek. This behavior was missing in 5.7.0, potentially causing changes in metrics.

v3.0.0

This release moves the build process to use XCFramework bundle type. For iOS, there are no changes required to your application code.

If you are using this SDK with TVOS the name of the module has changed (the Tv suffix is no longer needed):

TVOS before 3.0:


```obj-c
@import MuxCoreTv;
```


TVOS after 3.0:


```obj-c
@import MuxCore;
```


v2.4.1

- (bugfix) Works around an issue where a view with no pre-roll ads, but with midroll and/or postroll ads will cause Mux to update the TTFF value erroneously

v3.0.0-beta.0

This release moves the build process to use XCFramework bundle type. For iOS, there are no changes required to your application code.

If you are using this SDK with TVOS the name of the module has changed (the Tv suffix is no longer needed):

TVOS before 3.0:


```obj-c
@import MuxCoreTv;
```


TVOS after 3.0:


```obj-c
@import MuxCore;
```


v2.4.0

 Adds support for player_remote_played and view_session_id.
 In addition to existing options that are provided via the MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData and MUXSDKCustomerVideoData objects, there is now support for MUXSDKCustomerViewData. The view_session_id may be set onMUXSDKCustomerViewData.

v2.3.0

- Update build process for Xcode 12 to exclude arm_64 architectures when building for simulator. Before Xcode 12, xcodebuild never built arm_64 slices for the simulator. Now, it does (in preparation for Apple silicon). Because arm_64 slices now get built for the simulator, lipo errors out, because it can't have the same architecture for two different platforms (it already has arm_64 for the device platform). This is a temporary work around until a later major version release which will use the new XCFramework hotness
- bump iOS deploy target to '9.0' in podspec and project build settings for Xcode 12 compatibility

v2.2.0

- bugfix: Removes erroneously committed logs from the compiled frameworks

v2.2.1

- bugfix - ignore scaling calculations when player or source width or height dimension is 0

v2.2.0

 Add support for renditionchange events
 Add support for orientationchange events

v2.1.3

- bugfix for request metrics calculation. If we don't have responseStart, fallback to requestStart in order to calculate throughput

v2.1.2

- bugfix - Use monotonically increasing time in Objc client library. Avoids a bug if system time changes during a view.

v2.1.1

- Expose videoSourceUrl on MUXSDKCustomerVideoData. This allows a user to set the videoSourceUrl (along with their other VideoData, in which case any videoSourceUrl that is inferred from the player will be ignored.

v2.1.0

- Fix build process for Xcode 11
- Make player_instance_id a full uuid-style string
- Make sure to always send player_instance_id
- Bump Mux API versions for new collectors/processors
