# Monitor JW Player

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/monitor-jw-player-web

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: npm install --save @mux/mux-data-jwplayer,
    yarn: yarn add @mux/mux-data-jwplayer,
    cdn:

<!--  Note that the KEY in the example should be replaced with the key
provided by JW Player for your account. -->

  }}
  exampleOrder="npm,yarn,cdn"
/>

Be sure to call initJWPlayerMux immediately after initializing JW Player so that Mux can attach as soon as possible.

The only required field in the options that you pass into @mux/mux-data-jwplayer is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data on initialization.


```js
initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000, you can use `initJWPlayerMux.utils.now()`
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```


For more information, view Make your data actionable.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call initJWPlayerMux. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `jwplayer` function
player.mux.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `jwplayer` function
player.mux.emit('videochange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `jwplayer` function
player.mux.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  disableCookies: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  respectDoNotTrack: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-jwplayer will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `jwplayer` function
player.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: translateContext(error.player_error_context)
  };
}

initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Ads tracking with @mux/mux-data-jwplayer

Mux supports JW Player's VAST integration for pre-, mid-, and post-roll ads. Simply configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

Other JW Player ad integrations, such as Google IMA and FreeWheel have not been tested, but may work out of the box. Please contact us with any questions.

Latency metrics with @mux/mux-data-jwplayer

Mux supports latency metrics by parsing the incoming HLS manifest. JW Player allows us to intercept the manifest response using an onXhrOpen hook.
This is not available in Safari browsers where HLS is played natively.


```js
var player = jwplayer('my-player').setup({
  playlist: [{
    sources: [{
      file: 'video.m3u8',
      onXhrOpen: function(xhr, url) {
        player.mux && player.mux.onXhrOpen(xhr, url);
      }
    }]
  }]
});

// Initialize Mux Data monitoring
initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  // ...
});
```


Customize beacon collection domain


```js
initJWPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```
