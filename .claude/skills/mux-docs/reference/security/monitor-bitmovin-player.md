# Monitor Bitmovin player

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-bitmovin-player

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: npm install --save @mux/mux-data-bitmovin,
    yarn: yarn add @mux/mux-data-bitmovin,
    cdn:

  }}
/>

Call bitmovin.player.Player like you normally would. Call initBitmovinMux with the player reference and the SDK options.

The only required field in the options that you pass into @mux/mux-data-bitmovin is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data on initialization.


```js
initBitmovinMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000, can use `initBitmovinMux.utils.now()`
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```


For more information, view Make your data actionable.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call initBitmovinMux. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `bitmovin.player.Player` function
player.mux.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `bitmovin.player.Player` function
player.mux.emit('videochange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `bitmovin.player.Player` function
player.mux.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
initBitmovinMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  disableCookies: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
initBitmovinMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  respectDoNotTrack: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-bitmovin will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `bitmovin.player.Player` function
player.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
  };
}

initBitmovinMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
initBitmovinMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Ads tracking with @mux/mux-data-bitmovin

Mux supports Bitmovin's VAST advertising client for pre-, mid-, and post-roll ads. Simply configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

The metrics for preroll request and response times, as well as number of requests, are pending an update to Bitmovin's API. Everything else will operate normally, but those metrics may be missing.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
initBitmovinMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```
