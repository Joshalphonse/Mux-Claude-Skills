# Monitor Roku

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/monitor-roku

Mux's Roku integration supports Roku SceneGraph applications, in conjunction with standard Video nodes. Mux runs as a Task alongside the Video node, and supports instances where the Video nodes are reused with additional content as well as when the Video nodes are reset between content.

Place the SDK file in your libs folder. The latest version of the SDK can be found here:


```sh
https://src.litix.io/roku/2/mux-analytics.brs
```


Create a new Task XML named MuxTask.xml inside your components folder and give it the following interface. This is used to link the mux-analytics.brs file into your application.


```html
<component name="MuxTask" extends="Task">
  <interface>
    <field id="video" type="node" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    <field id="config" type="assocarray" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    <field id="rafEvent" type="assocarray" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    <field id="error" type="assocarray" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    <field id="view" type="String" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    <field id="exit" type="Boolean" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    <field id="exitType" type="String" alwaysNotify="true" value="hard" />
    <field id="useRenderStitchedStream" type="Boolean" alwaysNotify="true" value="false"/>
    <field id="useSSAI" type="Boolean" alwaysNotify="true" value="false"/>
    <field id="disableAutomaticErrorTracking" type="Boolean" alwaysNotify="true" value="false"/>
    <field id="randomMuxViewerId" type="Boolean" value="false"/>
  </interface>
  <script type="text/brightscript" uri="pkg:/libs/mux-analytics.brs"/>
</component>
```


Within your main application, create the Mux Task node, and pass the Video node that you are tracking to it. This should be done before the content is set into the Video node so that Mux can track the load process.


```js
m.mux = m.top.CreateNode("mux")
m.mux.setField("video", m.video)

muxConfig = {
  env_key: "ENV_KEY",
}

m.mux.setField("config", muxConfig)
m.mux.control = "RUN"

' Load the video into the Video node
```


After you've integrated, start playing a video in the player you've integrated with. A few minutes after you stop watching, you'll see the results in your Mux account. We'll also email you when your first video view has been recorded.

You can also test that Mux is receiving data in the Mux Data dashboard. Login to the dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your ENV_KEY and look for video views.

Note that it may take a few minutes for views to show up in the Mux Data dashboard.

To help you with the integration process and ensure you have successfully incorporated the SDK within your player, we have provided a number of optional manifest attributes. These attributes can help you better understand how the MUX SDK event tracking works as well as show you the actual data being collected. Some of the benefits of using some of the debugging attributes (mentioned below) are that you will be able to see the SDK events and data collected as it occurs.

```


----
mux_base_url

Values
Protocol + domain name. Eg. https://img.litix.io

Description
Controls to which domain the data should be sent. Useful for environmental builds of your project

The Roku SDK supports adding metadata via two different mechanisms.

The majority of the metadata should be passed inside the muxConfig object that is passed to the Mux Task. You can read detailed information about the fields that are supported in Metadata. To update any field, update this within muxConfig and then call m.mux.setField("config", muxConfig).

Some other underlying information is mapped from standard Roku content metadata, most of which you probably already set when creating your video. In particular, the metadata fields that you should set (if you do not already) are:
 - ContentType
 - URL
 - Live
 - StreamFormat
 - Length

If advertising is to be used, you must send the appropriate events to the Mux Task, as shown below.


```js
function setUpRokuAdFramework
  adIface.SetTrackingCallback(adTrackingCallback, adIface)
end function

function adTrackingCallback(obj = Invalid as Dynamic, eventType = Invalid as Dynamic, ctx = Invalid as Dynamic)
  m.mux = GetGlobalAA().global.findNode("mux")
  adUrl = Invalid
  if obj <> Invalid
    adUrl = obj.getAdUrl()
  end if
  m.mux.setField("rafEvent", {obj: { adurl: adUrl }, eventType:eventType, ctx:ctx})
end function
```


If you are utilizing RAF's renderStitchedStream method to stitch ads and content together client-side, then you must tell the Mux SDK that this is in use. This is set via useRenderStitchedStream on the Mux Task, set to true, such as:


```js
mux.setField("useRenderStitchedStream", true)
```


If you are _not_ utilizing renderStitchedStream but instead controlling ad and content playback directly, then you need to set useRenderStitchedStream to false.

If you are utilizing server-side ad insertion (SSAI), you should signal that to the SDK by setting useSSAI to true:


```js
mux.setField("useSSAI", true)
```


Controlling View Start and End Directly

In some situations, it is necessary to directly signal the beginning or ending of a view to Mux. This is necessary when the Video Node is recycled (i.e. more pieces of content are loaded into the same Node), or when using advertising, as the ads run outside of the lifecycle of the Video.

Note: A view is defined as the user watching a single piece of _content_, which includes any advertising.


```js
mux = GetGlobalAA().global.findNode("mux")

' To signal the start of a view:
mux.setField("view", "start")

' To signal the end of a view:
mux.setField("view", "end")
```


The exitType setting controls the behavior of the task when a request to exit/terminate the thread is invoked (via mux.exit=true). The default value of exitType is hard.

If the value is set to hard then the thread terminates immediately and any data that has not propagated already to the MUX servers is lost.

If the value is set to soft then the thread sends all the remaining data to the MUX servers and terminates afterward.

To change value to soft call m.mux.setField("exitType", "soft")

NOTE: This means that there might be a time difference between you calling mux.exit=true and the task thread actually terminating. Please ensure you have a single MUX Task running at any given time.

Disabling Automatic Error Tracking

The Mux SDK for Roku tracks error events from the Video node automatically, and reports them as fatal playback errors. If you would like to disable this automatic error tracking, you can set the following in your MuxTask.xml:


```js
<field id="disableAutomaticErrorTracking" type="Boolean" alwaysNotify="true" value="true"/>
```


While it is not advised to control this at runtime, you can also set this by calling


```js
mux.setField("disableAutomaticErrorTracking", true)
```


In order to emit events, you will need to trigger any errors directly, by calling


```js
mux.setField("error", {
  player_error_code: errorCode,
  player_error_message: errorMessage,
  player_error_context: errorContext,
  player_error_severity: errorSeverity,
  player_error_business_exception: isBusinessException
})
```


The error code and message should always be provided, and you can set the other fields if desired. The possible values or errorSeverity are "warning" or "fatal". Read more about Error Classification for more details.

CDN Tracking

The Mux SDK for Roku can listen to CDN change events. In order to emit events, you will need to trigger any CDN changes directly, by calling


```js
' The "new_cdn" string should be the new CDN name
mux.setField("cdn", "new_cdn")
```


Rebuffer Controls

Mux does not suggest disabling the automatic rebuffer tracking. The following is for advanced usage only.

The Mux SDK for Roku tracks error events from the Video node automatically. If you would like to disable this automatic rebuffer tracking, you can set the following in your MuxTask.xml:


```js
<field id="disablePlayheadRebufferTracking" type="Boolean" alwaysNotify="true" value="true"/>
```


While it is not advised to control this at runtime, you can also set this by calling


```js
mux.setField("disablePlayheadRebufferTracking", true)
```


Rebuffer start and end events can be emitted by calling the following


```js
mux.setField("rebufferstart", true)
```



```js
mux.setField("rebufferend", true)
```


Playback Mode

A playback mode event can be emitted by calling the following


```js
mux.setField("playback_mode", {
  player_playback_mode: mode,
  player_playback_mode_data: data
})
```


The mode should always be provided, suggested values are: inline, fullscreen, mini and pip.
The data is optional, if provided it should be a parse-able JSON string.

A playbackmodechange event will be emitted containing the following fields:

- player_playback_mode (containing the mode set)
- player_playback_mode_data (containing the data set)
- ad_playing_time_ms_cumulative (containing ad watch time)
- view_playing_time_ms_cumulative (containing the total content watch time plus ad watch time)

Network custom request event

Custom request events can be emitted with custom data for network requests by calling the following


```js
mux.setField("request", manifestRequest)
```


The manifestRequest must be a parse-able JSON string.

The following fields can be included in manifestRequest. All fields should be numeric values, not strings, except where noted:

- type (required, string) - The status of the request: completed, failed, or canceled
- request_start (numeric) - Timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch when the request was initiated
- request_response_start (numeric) - Timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch when the first byte of the response was received
- request_response_end (numeric) - Timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch when the last byte of the response was received
- request_bytes_loaded (numeric) - The total number of bytes loaded as part of this request
- request_hostname (string) - The hostname portion of the URL that was requested
- request_type (string) - The type of content being requested. One of: manifest, video, audio, video_init, audio_init, media, subtitle, or encryption
- request_id (string) - A unique identifier for the request
- request_url (string) - The URL that was requested
- request_labeled_bitrate (numeric) - Labeled bitrate in bps of the video, audio, or media segment that was downloaded
- request_response_headers (object) - A map of response headers and their values
- request_media_duration (numeric) - The duration of the media loaded, in seconds. Should not be included for manifest requests
- request_video_width (numeric) - For events with media or video request_type, the width of the video included in the segment/fragment
- request_video_height (numeric) - For events with media or video request_type, the height of the video included in the segment/fragment
- request_error (string) - The name of the error event that occurred (e.g., FragLoadError)
- request_error_code (numeric) - The response code of the request that spawned the error (e.g., 401, 400, 500)
- request_error_text (string) - The message returned with the failed status code

Depending on the type value, a corresponding event will be emitted: requestcompleted (for type: "completed"), requestfailed (for type: "failed"), or requestcanceled (for type: "canceled").

For more information about these fields, see Network Request Data.

Latency and Throughput Calculation

If you set request_start, request_response_start, request_response_end, and request_bytes_loaded, latency and throughput will be automatically calculated and sent in each event.

- Latency is calculated as the time between request_start and request_response_start.
- Throughput is calculated as request_bytes_loaded divided by the time between request_response_start and request_response_end.

Request Duration Calculation

If the request is completed (type is "completed"), the request_type is "api" or "encryption", and both request_start and request_response_end are present as valid numeric values, the total request duration (request_duration) will be calculated as request_response_end - request_start and included in the event. Requests of type "api" or "encryption" are limited to a maximum of 5 per view; if this limit is exceeded, the event is discarded and not sent to Mux.
