# Monitor CTS PDK

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-cts-pdk

If installing from the MPX Console, load ctx-mux from the CDN:


```curl
https://src.litix.io/cts/3/cts-mux.js
```


If installing in the player embed, follow the example below


```html
<div class="tpPlayer"
     id="player"
     // ... other configuration options
     tp:muxPlugin = "priority=1|URL=https://src.litix.io/cts/3/cts-mux.js|env_key=ENV_KEY|debug=false">
</div>
<script>
  // Creates the Player object that builds the component.
  const player = new Player("player");
  player.bind("player");
</script>
```


The only required field in the SDK options is env_key. Mux will automatically pull some metadata fields like video_id, video_title, and video_duration from the player itself. You can optionally override these values in the plugin parameters. Providing useful metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata fields separated by | with the plugin parameters.


```html
<div class="tpPlayer"
     id="player"
     // ... other configuration options
     tp:muxPlugin = "priority=1|URL=https://src.litix.io/cts/3/cts-mux.js|env_key=ENV_KEY|debug=false|player_name='EXAMPLE_PLAYER_NAME'|player_version=1.0.0">
</div>
<script>
  // Creates the Player object that builds the component.
  const player = new Player("player");
  player.bind("player");
</script>
```


The only required field in the options that you pass into the data options in the player.mux function is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

For more information, view Make your data actionable.

Changing the video

If the underlying source changes of the video within the same player, cts-mux will track this change automatically. No extra configuration is needed.

Disable cookies

By default, cts-mux uses a cookie to track playback across subsequent page views. This cookie includes information about the tracking of the viewer, such as an anonymized viewer ID that Mux generates for each user. None of this information is personally-identifiable, but you can disable the use of this cookie if desired. For instance, if your site or application is targeted towards children under 13, you should disable the use of cookies.

This is done by setting disableCookies=true in the options passed to the Mux plugin.


```html
<div class="tpPlayer"
     id="player"
     // ... other configuration options
     tp:muxPlugin = "priority=1|URL=https://src.litix.io/cts/3/cts-mux.js|env_key=ENV_KEY|debug=false|player_name='EXAMPLE_PLAYER_NAME'|disableCookies=true>
</div>
<script>
  // Creates the Player object that builds the component.
  const player = new Player("player");
  player.bind("player");
</script>
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior

By default, cts-mux does not respect Do Not Track when set within browsers. This can be enabled in the options passed to Mux, via a setting named respectDoNotTrack. The default for this is false. If you would like to change this behavior, pass respectDoNotTrack=true.


```html
<div class="tpPlayer"
     id="player"
     // ... other configuration options
     tp:muxPlugin = "priority=1|URL=https://src.litix.io/cts/3/cts-mux.js|env_key=ENV_KEY|debug=false|player_name='EXAMPLE_PLAYER_NAME'|respectDoNotTrack=true>
</div>
<script>
  // Creates the Player object that builds the component.
  const player = new Player("player");
  player.bind("player");
</script>
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

There is currently no way to change the default error tracking behavior. If this is something you need in your CTS PDK integration, please reach out.

Ads tracking with cts-mux

Mux has been tested with CTS's VAST plugin for ad support. Configure the VAST plugin as you would with your PDK player normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.
