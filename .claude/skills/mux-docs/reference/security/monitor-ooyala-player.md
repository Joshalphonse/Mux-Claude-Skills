# Monitor Ooyala player

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-ooyala-player

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.


```html
<!-- Include ooyala-mux after the core Ooyala javascript files -->
<script src="https://player.ooyala.com/static/v4/stable/latest/core.min.js"></script>
<!-- Insert other Ooyala plugin files here -->
<script src="https://src.litix.io/ooyala/4/ooyala-mux.js"></script>
```


Call OO.player.create like you normally would. Call initOoyalaMux with the player reference in the onCreate callback.


```html
<div id="my-player"></div>
<script>
  let playerInitTime;

  // Use a callback for when the player is created to register Mux Data
  function onPlayerCreated (player) {
    initOoyalaMux(player, {
      debug: false,
      data: {
        env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
        // Metadata
        player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
        player_init_time: playerInitTime // ex: 1451606400000
        // ... and other metadata
      }
    }
  });

  const asset = {
    // Insert Ooyala asset configuration here
  };

  const playerConfig = {
    onCreate: onPlayerCreated,
    // Insert other Ooyala player configuration (e.g. autoplay etc) here
  };

  // Create the player with the Mux callback
  OO.ready(function() {
    playerInitTime = initOoyalaMux.utils.now();
    OO.player.create('playerdiv', asset, playerConfig)
  });
</script>
```


The only required field in the options that you pass into ooyala-mux is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data on initialization.


```js
initOoyalaMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```

New source


```js
// player is the instance received in the `onCreate` callback
player.mux.emit('videochange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance received in the `onCreate` callback
player.mux.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
initOoyalaMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  disableCookies: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
initOoyalaMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  respectDoNotTrack: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, ooyala-mux will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance received in the `onCreate` callback
player.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
  };
}

initOoyalaMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
initOoyalaMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Ads tracking with ooyala-mux

Mux has been tested with and supports Ooyala's google-ima-ads-manager. Configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

Other Ooyala ad integrations, such as FreeWheel and VAST/VPAID may work out of the box. Please contact us with any questions.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
initOoyalaMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```
