# Samsung-Tizen

Mux Data is the best way to monitor video streaming performance.

Integration is easy - just initialize the Mux SDK, pass in some metadata, and you're up and running in minutes.

This documents integration instructions for Samsung Tizen TVs. For other players, see the additional Integration Guides.

Mux Data supports applications built for Samsung Tizen TVs using JavaScript and Tizen's AVPlay API. The Samsung Tizen Smart TV SDK supports C++, JavaScript, and Microsoft .NET; this SDK is only compatible with JavaScript applications using AVPlay.

Include the Mux Data SDK by including the tizen-mux.js JavaScript file within your index.html file defining your application. You can use the Mux-hosted version of the script to receive automatic updates. (The API will not change within major versions, as in tizen/MAJOR_VERSION/tizen-mux.js.)


```html
<!-- place within the <head> of your index.html -->
<script src="//src.litix.io/tizen/2/tizen-mux.js"></script>
```


To monitor video playback within your Tizen application, pass the AVPlay player instance to monitorTizenPlayer along with SDK options and metadata.


```js
// Place in your application initialization code, around
// where you call `prepare`

var player = $('#my-player').get(0);
player.url = this.url;
var playerInitTime = monitorTizenPlayer.utils.now();
this.prepare();
monitorTizenPlayer(player, {
  debug: true,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Metadata
    player_name: 'Custom Player', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_init_time: playerInitTime,
    // ... additional metadata
  },
  // Optional passthrough listener
  playbackListener: playbackListener
});
```


Tizen's AVPlay API does not allow multiple AVPlayPlaybackCallback listeners to be registered to a player. If you require your own listener to be registered, you must pass this in as playbackListener as shown above. Mux's SDK will proxy the calls to your listener. (Note: the location of this changed with v1.0.0)

To stop monitoring your player (e.g. when playback is complete), call player.mux.stopMonitor().

Log in to the Mux dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your env_key and look for video views. It takes about a minute or two from tracking a view for it to show up on the Metrics tab.

If you aren't seeing data, check to see if you have an ad blocker, tracking blocker or some kind of network firewall that prevents your player from sending requests to Mux Data servers.

Detailed Documentation

Options are provided via the data object passed in the call to monitorTizenPlayer.

All metadata details except for env_key are optional, however you'll be able to compare and see more interesting results as you include more details. This gives you more metrics and metadata about video streaming, and allows you to search and filter on important fields like the player version, CDN, and video title.


```js
monitorTizenPlayer(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```


For more information, see the Metadata Guide.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
monitorTizenPlayer(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', //ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // ,,,
  }
});
```
