# Monitor Chromecast

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-chromecast

Mux Data is the best way to monitor video streaming performance.

Integration is easy - just initialize the Mux SDK, pass in some metadata, and you're up and running in minutes.

This documents integration instructions for Chromecast. For other players, see the additional Integration Guides.

Mux supports Chromecast applications that are built on top of the Cast Application Framework CAF Receiver SDK. The CAF Receiver SDK supports the following streaming protocols.

A Chromecast application contains two main components: a sender and a receiver. The Mux Data SDK is integrated at the receiver side; include the chromecast-mux.js JavaScript file within your custom receiver application. You can use the Mux-hosted version of the script to receive automatic updates. (The API will not change within major versions, as in chromecast/MAJOR_VERSION/chromecast-mux.js).

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: npm install --save @mux/mux-data-chromecast,
    yarn: yarn add @mux/mux-data-chromecast,
    cdn: `,
  }}
  exampleOrder="npm,yarn,cdn"
/>

To monitor video playback within your Chromecast application, pass the PlayerManager instance to initChromecastMux along with SDK options and metadata.

You can initialize within a message interceptor for the LOAD event, or immediately on app load as before. This suggestion changed in version 4.0.0 and newer.


```js
import initChromecastMux from '@mux/mux-data-chromecast';

var app = {
  init: function () {
    const context = cast.framework.CastReceiverContext.getInstance();
    const playerManager = context.getPlayerManager();
    let firstPlay = true;
    let playerInitTime = initChromecastMux.utils.now();

    playerManager.setMessageInterceptor(cast.framework.messages.MessageType.LOAD, loadRequestData => {
      if (firstPlay) {
        initChromecastMux(playerManager, {
          debug: false,
          data : {
            env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required

            // Metadata
            player_name: 'Custom Player', // ex: 'My Main Player'
            player_init_time: playerInitTime,

            // ... additional metadata
          }
        });
      }

      return loadRequestData;
    });

    context.start();
  }
};

$(document).ready(function () {
  app.init();
});
```


After you've finished integration, the quickest way to see that the SDK is loaded is to pass debug: true in the options passed to the SDK. With this flag enabled, you can open the debug console, and you should start seeing debug statements from [mux] when you click play on the video.

After playing a video, a few minutes after you stop watching, you'll see the results in your Mux account. We'll also email you when your first video view has been recorded. Log in to the dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your env_key and look for video views.

Note that it may take a few minutes for views to show up in the Mux Data dashboard.

Detailed Documentation

Options are provided via the data object passed in the call to initChromecastMux.

All metadata details except for env_key are optional, however you'll be able to compare and see more interesting results as you include more details. This gives you more metrics and metadata about video streaming, and allows you to search and filter on important fields like the player version, CDN, and video title.

For more information, see the Metadata Guide.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call initChromecastMux. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
playerManager.mux.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source

The source change should be done by intercepting the cast.framework.messages.MessageType.LOAD message and doing the following:


```js
playerManager.setMessageInterceptor(cast.framework.messages.MessageType.LOAD, loadRequestData => {
  // It's important to only call this on subsequent videos being loaded, not
  // the first playback (where you call `initChromecastMux`).
  if (!firstVideo) {
    playerManager.mux.emit('videochange', { ... });
  }

  return loadRequestData;
});
```


New program

Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-chromecast will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
playerManager.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: translateContext(error.player_error_context)
  };
}

initChromecastMux(playerManager, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator: errorTranslator,
  data : {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Metadata
    player_name: 'Custom Player', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    // ... additional metadata
  }
});

```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
initChromecastMux(playerManager, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data : {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Metadata
    player_name: 'Custom Player', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    // ... additional metadata
  }
});
```


Customize beacon collection domain


```js
initChromecastMux(playerManager, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Destroying the Monitor

There are certain use cases where you want to stop monitoring playback within a player (for instance if the player is no longer being used, you are recycling players, or you are shutting down the application). In this case, you should make sure to destroy the monitor. This can be done by simply calling playerManager.mux.destroy().
