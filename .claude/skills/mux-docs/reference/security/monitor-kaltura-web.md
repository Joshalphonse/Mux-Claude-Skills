# Monitor Kaltura Web

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/monitor-kaltura-web

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: "npm install --save @mux/mux-data-kaltura",
    yarn: "yarn add @mux/mux-data-kaltura",
    cdn: `,
  }}
  exampleOrder="npm,yarn,cdn"
/>

Under the Kaltura plugins option, pass in the mux configuration with key mux.

Log in to the Mux dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your env_key and look for video views. It takes about a minute or two from tracking a view for it to show up on the Metrics tab.

If you aren't seeing data, check to see if you have an ad blocker, tracking blocker or some kind of network firewall that prevents your player from sending requests to Mux Data servers.

The only required field in the options that you pass into @mux/mux-data-kaltura is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data key, in the mux plugin configuration.

For more information, view Make your data actionable.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first initialize the Mux SDK. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `KalturaPlayer.setup` function
player.mux.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `KalturaPlayer.setup` function
player.mux.emit('videochange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `KalturaPlayer.setup` function
player.mux.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
var kalturaPlayer = KalturaPlayer.setup({
  // ...
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      debug: false,
      disableCookies: true,
      data: {
        env_key: "ENV_KEY",
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
var kalturaPlayer = KalturaPlayer.setup({
  // ...
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      respectDoNotTrack: true,
      data: {
        env_key: "ENV_KEY",
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-kaltura will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance returned by the `KalturaPlayer.setup` function
player.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: translateContext(error.player_error_context)
  };
}

var kalturaPlayer = KalturaPlayer.setup({
  // ...
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      errorTranslator,
      data: {
        env_key: "ENV_KEY",
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
var kalturaPlayer = KalturaPlayer.setup({
  // ...
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      automaticErrorTracking: false,
      data: {
        env_key: "ENV_KEY",
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```


Ads tracking with @mux/mux-data-kaltura

Mux supports Kaltura's playkit-js-ima plugin for pre-, mid-, and post-roll ads. Simply configure these plugins as you would normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

Other Kaltura ad integrations have not been tested, but may work out of the box. Please contact us with any questions.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
var kalturaPlayer = KalturaPlayer.setup({
  // ...
  plugins: {
    mux: {
      beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
      data: {
        env_key: "ENV_KEY",
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```
