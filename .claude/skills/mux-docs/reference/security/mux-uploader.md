# Mux Uploader for web

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/mux-uploader

Mux Uploader is a drop-in web component that makes it easy to upload video files to Mux.

This component allows you to build a fully-functional, customizable video upload UI in your application using a single line of code. Mux Uploader supports:

- Manual file selection
- Drag and drop for files
- Optional pausing and resuming of uploads
- Automatic offline/online detection with upload resumes
- And more!

Mux Uploader can be used as either a web component (` from @mux/mux-uploader), or a React component ( from @mux/mux-uploader-react).

Quick start

Here are some examples of Mux Uploader in action.

Mux Uploader HTML element

Install with either npm, yarn or load Mux Uploader from the hosted script.

NPM


```shell
npm install @mux/mux-uploader@latest
```


Yarn


```shell
yarn add @mux/mux-uploader@latest
```


Hosted


```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mux/mux-uploader"></script>
```


Example HTML element implementation


```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mux/mux-uploader"
></script>
<mux-uploader></mux-uploader>
```


Mux Uploader React component

You will need to select one of the package options below. Both examples will automatically update the uploader. You can always anchor the package to a specific version if needed.

NPM


```shell
npm install @mux/mux-uploader-react@latest
```


Yarn


```shell
yarn add @mux/mux-uploader-react@latest
```


Example React Usage


```jsx
import MuxUploader from "@mux/mux-uploader-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MuxUploader/>
  );
}
```


Upload a video

Mux Uploader allows you to use upload URLs provided by Mux's Direct Uploads in your web application.
It takes care of rendering a file selector, uploading your video file, displaying progress updates to the user, handling retries, and more.

This does mean that you'll need to provide a new upload URL whenever a user will be uploading a new video file in your application. You provide that URL value via the endpoint attribute or property. It looks like this:

HTML example

The endpoint indicates the direct upload URL that will receive the video file you're uploading.

You can generate a signed direct upload URL by making a server-side API call to Mux's Create Direct Upload endpoint,
or you can use curl based on the example from the link if you just want to test it out.

In a successful API response, you will receive a unique signed upload URL that can then be passed along to your client application and set as the endpoint property on a mux-uploader element. The URL for a Direct Upload looks like "https://storage.googleapis.com/video...".

In the following examples, you will replace the value of the endpoint property with your unique direct upload URL.

React example

Overview of the upload process

Video uploads and processing take time. Processing time can vary depending on the file size and type of video that you upload.

Mux uses webhooks to keep your application informed about what's happening with your uploaded video — from when the upload completes to when the video is ready to be played.

To minimize processing time, consider following Mux's guide for handling standard video input.

The overall flow generally looks like this:

1. Set up webhooks
- Set up a public webhook endpoint in your application to receive events from Mux
- Configure the webhook in your Mux dashboard to send events to this endpoint

2. Upload the video
- Create a direct upload URL using the Mux API
- Save the upload ID to your database
- Pass the URL to the endpoint property on the Mux Uploader component

3. Wait for video to be ready
- When the upload completes, show a "processing" indicator to the user.
- Poll your database to check if the video is ready for playback.

4. Handle webhook events

Listen for specific webhook events, particularly:

- video.upload.asset_created which indicates that the upload has completed and an asset has been created
- video.asset.ready which indicates that the video has been processed and is ready for playback

The video.upload.asset_created event contains the asset_id in the event payload.
The video.asset.ready event contains the playback_id in the event payload.

5. Store the information in your database

Save the asset_id and playback_id to your database, associating them with the user or relevant entity in your application.

Here's an example of how you might structure your database table schema:

| videos                    |                        |            |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| id                       | uuid (primary key)     |            |
| user_id                  | uuid (foreign key)     | References users.id |
| upload_id                | string                 | From initial upload |
| asset_id                 | string                 | From Mux webhook |
| playback_id              | string                 | From Mux webhook |
| title                    | string                 | Optional metadata |
| status                   | enum                   | e.g. preparing, ready |
| created_at               | timestamp              |            |
| updated_at               | timestamp              |            |

6. Use the IDs

While Mux generates several IDs during the upload and processing flow, there are two key IDs you'll primarily work with:

1. The asset_id: This is used when you need to manage your video through the Mux API (like deleting the video or checking its status)
2. The playback_id: This is what you'll use to actually play your video, either by:
   - Adding it to Mux Player
   - Creating a URL where your video can be played

Note that this process happens asynchronously, so your application should be designed to handle the delay between the initial upload and when the video becomes available for playback.

For more detailed implementations, you can refer to the examples provided in the Mux documentation for various frameworks:

- Next.js
- SvelteKit
- Astro
- Remix

Fetching the upload URL async

At the time you render the , you may not have the direct upload URL yet. Instead, you might want to retrieve it async from your server after a user selects a file. You can do that by setting the endpoint property value to a custom function instead of a URL.


```html
<mux-uploader></mux-uploader>

<script>
  const muxUploader = document.querySelector("mux-uploader");
  /*
    Endpoint should be a function that returns a promise and resolves
    with a string for the upload URL.
  */
  muxUploader.endpoint = function () {
    /*
      In this example, your server endpoint would return the upload URL
      in the response body "https://storage.googleapis.com/video..."
    */
    return fetch("/your-server/api/create-upload").then(res => res.text());
  };
</script>
```


This is even easier using React props:


```jsx
import MuxUploader from "@mux/mux-uploader-react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MuxUploader
      endpoint={() => {
        return fetch("/your-server/api/create-upload")
          .then(res => res.text());
      }}
    />
  );
}
```


Customizing the UI

As you can see in the examples above, Mux Uploader provides a fairly feature rich and reasonably styled (albeit basic) UI by default.

It will automatically update based on different stages or states of uploading, like showing a UI for file selection before a video has been picked,
showing progress as the file is uploaded, showing when the file upload has completed, and showing error state with the option to retry if something
goes wrong with the upload.

In addition, Mux Uploader provides many ways to customize this look and feel, including:

- attributes / properties like no-drop or pausable to enable/disable UI components
- intuitive styling with CSS, just like any other HTML element.
- state transition attributes like upload-in-progress or upload-error for responsive styling
- attribute / property based data customization for things like dynamic-chunk-size or max-file-size
- overridable and composable components like  or ` for full flexibility of UI
