# Content Security Policy for Mux

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/core/content-security-policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps protect your web application from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection attacks. CSP works by restricting the resources (such as scripts, stylesheets, images, and network connections) that a web page can load.

When integrating Mux Video and Mux Data into your application, you'll need to configure your CSP to allow connections to Mux services. This guide will help you set up the appropriate CSP directives to ensure your Mux integration works securely.

  If you're new to Content Security Policy, we recommend reading Google's CSP guide for a comprehensive introduction to CSP concepts and implementation.

For most applications, the simplest approach is to use a basic CSP that allows all Mux services. This configuration ensures compatibility with all current and future Mux features:


```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' *.mux.com *.litix.io storage.googleapis.com
```


This CSP directive allows your application to:
- Load resources from your own domain ('self')
- Connect to all Mux Video services (.mux.com)
- Connect to all Mux Data services (.litix.io)
- Connect to Google Cloud Storage (storage.googleapis.com) -- this is needed for Direct Uploads

The wildcard approach for mux.com and litix.io is recommended because Mux utilizes multiple CDNs and subdomains to provide optimal performance globally. These hostnames may change without notice as we optimize our infrastructure.

If your security requirements call for a more restrictive CSP, you can use specific directives instead of the broad default-src approach. Here's a granular configuration that covers all Mux functionality:


```
Content-Security-Policy:
  connect-src 'self' https://*.mux.com https://*.litix.io https://storage.googleapis.com;
  media-src 'self' blob: https://*.mux.com;
  img-src 'self' https://image.mux.com https://*.litix.io;
  script-src 'self' https://src.litix.io;
  worker-src 'self' blob:
```


  The above configuration must be merged with your existing CSP directives. Each directive should combine values from both your current policy and the Mux requirements.

If your application uploads media files to Mux via Direct Uploads, you'll need additional CSP directives to handle binary data and file uploads:


```
Content-Security-Policy:
  connect-src 'self' https://*.mux.com https://*.litix.io https://storage.googleapis.com;
  media-src 'self' blob: https://*.mux.com;
  img-src 'self' https://image.mux.com https://*.litix.io;
  script-src 'self' https://src.litix.io;
  worker-src 'self' blob:;
  form-action 'self' https://*.mux.com https://storage.googleapis.com
```


The key additions for upload functionality are:

| Directive | Purpose |
| :-------- | :------ |
| https://storage.googleapis.com in connect-src | Allows uploads to Google Cloud Storage endpoints used by Mux |
| form-action directive | Permits form submissions and PUT/POST requests to upload endpoints |
| blob: in media-src and worker-src | Enables handling of binary file data during upload processing |

Different Mux features have specific CSP requirements. Here's what you need for each:

Mux Video Playback

For video playback functionality, you must include:


```
connect-src https://*.mux.com;
media-src blob: https://*.mux.com;
worker-src blob:
```


This is required because:
- HLS manifests and video segments are delivered via https://stream.mux.com and other .mux.com subdomains
- Video players use web workers and blob URLs for optimal performance
- Mux uses multiple CDNs with different hostnames for global performance

Video Thumbnails and Storyboards

If you're displaying video thumbnails or timeline hover previews, include:


```
img-src https://image.mux.com;
connect-src https://image.mux.com
```


The connect-src directive is needed for dynamic thumbnail loading in timeline hover previews, while img-src covers standard image embedding.

Mux Data Integration

For Mux Data analytics, you must allow:


```
connect-src https://*.litix.io;
img-src https://*.litix.io
```


This covers:
- Data collection endpoints across multiple subdomains
- Fallback beacon loading through image tags
- Various monitoring and analytics endpoints

  For tighter security, you can replace https://.litix.io with https://img.litix.io and https://.litix.io where `` is your Mux environment key. However, the wildcard approach is recommended for maximum compatibility.

Hosted Mux Data Integrations

If you're loading pre-built Mux Data integrations from our hosted domain (rather than installing via NPM), add:


```
script-src https://src.litix.io
```


This is not required if you bundle the Mux Data SDK directly into your application code.

Complete Example

Here's a complete CSP that supports all Mux features including uploads:


```
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self' https://*.mux.com https://*.litix.io https://storage.googleapis.com;
  media-src 'self' blob: https://*.mux.com;
  img-src 'self' https://image.mux.com https://*.litix.io;
  script-src 'self' https://src.litix.io;
  worker-src 'self' blob:;
  form-action 'self' https://*.mux.com https://storage.googleapis.com
```


  After implementing your CSP, test all Mux functionality in your application including video playback, uploads, thumbnails, and analytics to ensure everything works as expected.
