# Monitor THEOplayer (Web)

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-theoplayer-web

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: npm install --save @mux/mux-data-theoplayer,
    yarn: yarn add @mux/mux-data-theoplayer,
    cdn:

,
  }}
  exampleOrder="npm,yarn,cdn"
/>

Call new THEOplayer.Player like you normally would. Call initTHEOplayerMux with a reference to the player instance and the Mux SDK options.

Passing in THEOplayer global

You'll see the 3rd argument to initTHEOplayerMux is THEOplayer. This is the global THEOplayer object. If you are using a bundler and importing THEOplayer with require or import then you'll need to pass in the THEOplayer object.

If no THEOplayer object is passed in, then initTHEOplayerMux will look for THEOplayer on then global window object.

The only required field in the options that you pass into initTHEOplayerMux is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data on initialization.


```js
// player here is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```


For more information, view Make your data actionable.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call initTHEOplayerMux. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
let monitor = initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY', // required

    video_id: 'abcd123',
  }
});

monitor.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source

For THEOplayer, you do not need to emit the videochange event when the player source property of the player is updated. The sourcechange event that is fired when you update the source property of the player is handled automatically. However, you still need to pass the updated video metadata under metadata.mux, as shown in the example below.

When this is done, it removes all previous video data and resets all metrics for the video view. Note: the previous method using changeMuxVideo has been deprecated, but will continue to work for 2.x versions of this plugin.


```js
player.source = {
  sources: {
    // ...your source
  },
  metadata: {
    mux: {
      video_id: 'new-ID',
      video_title: 'New title',
      // ... other metadata
    }
  }
}
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
let monitor = initTHEOPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});

// emit `programchange` when the content within the stream changes
monitor.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
// player here is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  disableCookies: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  respectDoNotTrack: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-theoplayer will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
let monitor = initTHEOPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});

// emit the `error` event when an error occurs
monitor.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: translateContext(error.player_error_context)
  };
}

// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Ads tracking with @mux/mux-data-theoplayer

Mux has been tested with and supports THEOplayer's Ads integration. Simply configure the ads as you would with THEOplayer normally, and Mux will track ads automatically. No additional configuration is needed.

Other THEOplayer ad integrations, such as Google IMA, may work out of the box but have not currently been tested. Please contact us with any questions.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Destroy the monitor

In some cases, you may want to stop tracking an instance of THEOplayer. To this, we provide a destroy method within the returned object of initTHEOplayerMux, which will immediately end the active Mux Data view and stop tracking the THEOplayer instance.


```
// player is the instance of THEOplayer.Player
let monitor = initTHEOplayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});

// once ready to destroy the monitor
monitor.destroy();
```
