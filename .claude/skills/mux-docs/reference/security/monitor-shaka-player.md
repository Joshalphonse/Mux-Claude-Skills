# Monitor Shaka player

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-shaka-player

Include the Mux JavaScript SDK on every page of your web app that includes video.

<CodeExamples
  examples={{
    npm: npm install --save @mux/mux-data-shakaplayer,
    yarn: yarn add @mux/mux-data-shakaplayer,
    cdn: '',
  }}
  exampleOrder="npm,yarn,cdn"
/>

Call new shaka.Player like you normally would and get the return value (a reference to the player). Call initShakaPlayerMux with the player reference and the SDK options.

Passing in shaka global

You'll see the 3rd argument to initShakaPlayerMux is shaka. This is the global shaka object. If you are using a bundler and importing shaka with require or import then you'll need to pass in the shaka object.

If no shaka object is passed in, then initShakaPlayerMux will look for shaka on then global window object.

The only required field in the options that you pass into @mux/mux-data-shakaplayer is env_key. But without some metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Pass in metadata under the data on initialization.


```js
initShakaPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  data: {
    env_key: 'ENV_KEY',
    // Site Metadata
    viewer_user_id: '', // ex: '12345'
    experiment_name: '', // ex: 'player_test_A'
    sub_property_id: '', // ex: 'cus-1'
    // Player Metadata
    player_name: '', // ex: 'My Main Player'
    player_version: '', // ex: '1.0.0'
    player_init_time: '', // ex: 1451606400000
    // Video Metadata
    video_id: '', // ex: 'abcd123'
    video_title: '', // ex: 'My Great Video'
    video_series: '', // ex: 'Weekly Great Videos'
    video_duration: '', // in milliseconds, ex: 120000
    video_stream_type: '', // 'live' or 'on-demand'
    video_cdn: '' // ex: 'Fastly', 'Akamai'
  }
});
```


For more information, view Make your data actionable.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call initShakaPlayerMux. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the updateData method.


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
player.mux.updateData({ video_title: 'My Updated Great Video' });
```


New source


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
player.mux.emit('videochange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


New program


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
player.mux.emit('programchange', {
  video_id: 'abc345',
  video_title: 'My Other Great Video',
  video_series: 'Weekly Great Videos',
  // ...
});
```


Disable cookies


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
initShakaPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  disableCookies: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Over-ride 'do not track' behavior


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
initShakaPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  respectDoNotTrack: true,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
});
```


Customize error tracking behavior

Errors tracked by mux are considered fatal meaning that they are the result of playback failures. If errors are non-fatal they should not be captured.

By default, @mux/mux-data-shakaplayer will track errors emitted from the video element as fatal errors. If a fatal error happens outside of the context of the player, you can emit a custom error to the mux monitor.


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
player.mux.emit('error', {
  player_error_code: 100,
  player_error_message: 'Description of error',
  player_error_context: 'Additional context for the error'
});
```


Error translator


```js
function errorTranslator (error) {
  return {
    player_error_code: translateCode(error.player_error_code),
    player_error_message: translateMessage(error.player_error_message),
    player_error_context: translateContext(error.player_error_context)
  };
}

// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
initShakaPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  errorTranslator,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Disable automatic error tracking


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
initShakaPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  automaticErrorTracking: false,
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```


Track Ad playback with a custom integration

Our integration for Shaka player does not have a built-in integration for tracking ad playback. If you would like to track ads played within Shaka player, you will need to build a custom integration, which is detailed here: Build a Custom Integration.

Customize beacon collection domain


```js
// player is the instance returned by `new shaka.Player`
initShakaPlayerMux(player, {
  debug: false,
  beaconCollectionDomain: 'CUSTOM_DOMAIN', // ex: 'foo.bar.com'
  data: {
    env_key: "ENV_KEY",
    // ...
  }
});
```
