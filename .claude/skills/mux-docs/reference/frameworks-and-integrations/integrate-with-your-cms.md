# Integrate with your CMS

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/integrations/cms

While Mux stores basic video metadata like titles and creator IDs, a content management system (CMS) can help you manage additional content around your videos - like descriptions, categories, related content, and other rich metadata that helps organize your video content within your application's broader content strategy.

Mux integrates with the following CMS applications to help you easily manage and deliver video content in your applications. These integrations allow you to easily incorporate Mux videos into your existing CMS workflow.
