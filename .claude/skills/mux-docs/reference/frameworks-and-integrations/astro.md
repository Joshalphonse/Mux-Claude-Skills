# Add high-performance video to your Astro application

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/frameworks/astro

When should you use Mux with Astro?
When adding video to your Astro app, you'll encounter some common hurdles. First, videos are large. Storing them in your public directory can lead to excessive bandwidth consumption and poor Git repository performance. Next, it's important to compress and optimize your videos for the web. Then, as network conditions change, you might want to adapt the quality of your video to ensure a smooth playback experience for your users. Finally, you may want to integrate additional features like captions, thumbnails, and analytics.

You might consider using Mux's APIs and components to handle these challenges, and more.

Use the API to build your video workflow

If you're looking to build your own video workflow that enables uploading, playback, and more in your application, you can use the Mux API and components like Mux Player and Mux Uploader.

Example: allowing users to upload video to your app
One reason you might want to build your own video workflow is when you want to allow users to upload video to your app.

  Much of the work described here is done on the server and is unique for every user. Make sure your Astro app is in SSR mode before you begin.

Let's start by adding a new page where users can upload videos. This will involve using the Mux Uploader component, which will upload videos to a Mux Direct Uploads URL.

First, install the Astro version of Mux Uploader:


```bash
npm install @mux/mux-uploader-astro
```


In the code sample below, we'll create an upload URL using the Mux Node SDK and the Direct Uploads URL API. We'll pass that URL to the native Astro ` component, which will handle uploading for us.


```astro filename=src/pages/index.astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Mux from "@mux/mux-node";
import MuxUploader from "@mux/mux-uploader-astro";

const mux = new Mux({
  tokenId: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID,
  tokenSecret: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET
});

const upload = await mux.video.uploads.create({
  new_asset_settings: {
    playback_policy: ['public'],
    video_quality: 'basic',
  },
  cors_origin: '*',
});
---

<Layout title="Upload a video to Mux">
  <MuxUploader endpoint={upload.url} />
</Layout>
```


In production, you'll want to apply additional security measures to your upload URL. Consider protecting the route with authentication to prevent unauthorized users from uploading videos. Also, use cors_origin and consider playback_policy to further restrict where uploads can be performed and who can view uploaded videos.

Next, we'll create an API endpoint that will listen for Mux webhooks. When we receive the notification that the video has finished uploading and is ready for playback, we'll add the video's metadata to our database.


```ts filename=src/pages/mux-webhook.json.ts
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';
import mux from '../lib/mux';

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request }) => {
  const body = await request.text();
  // mux.webhooks.unwrap will validate that the given payload was sent by Mux and parse the payload.
  // It will also provide type-safe access to the payload.
  // Generate MUX_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET in the Mux dashboard
  // https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/webhooks
  const event = mux.webhooks.unwrap(
    body,
    request.headers,
    process.env.MUX_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET
  );

  // you can also unwrap the payload yourself:
  // const event = await request.json();
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'video.upload.asset_created':
      // we might use this to know that an upload has been completed
      // and we can save its assetId to our database
      break;
    case 'video.asset.ready':
      // we might use this to know that a video has been encoded
      // and we can save its playbackId to our database
      break;
    // there are many more Mux webhook events
    // check them out at https://www.mux.com/docs/webhook-reference
    default:
      break;
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'ok' }), {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });
};
```


Finally, let's make a playback page. We retrieve the video metadata from our database, and play it by passing its playbackId to Mux Player.

First, install the Astro version of Mux Player:


```bash
npm install @mux/mux-player-astro
```


Now create your playback page using the native Astro  component:


```astro filename=src/pages/playback/[playbackId].astro
---
import Layout from '../../layouts/Layout.astro';
import MuxPlayer from "@mux/mux-player-astro";

const { playbackId } = Astro.params;
---

<Layout>
  <MuxPlayer
    playbackId={playbackId}
    metadata={{video_title: 'My Video'}}
  />
</Layout>
```


And we've got upload and playback. Nice!

Retrieving asset data with the Mux Node SDK

You can use the Mux Node SDK to retrieve information about your videos and pass that data to your Astro components. This is useful for displaying video metadata like title, duration, and upload date.


```bash
npm install @mux/mux-node
```


Here's an example of fetching video asset data and using it in your component:


```astro filename=src/pages/video/[assetId].astro
---
import Layout from '../../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Mux from "@mux/mux-node";
import MuxPlayer from "@mux/mux-player-astro";

const mux = new Mux({
  tokenId: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID,
  tokenSecret: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET,
});

const { assetId } = Astro.params;
const asset = await mux.video.assets.retrieve(assetId);

const playbackId = asset.playback_ids?.find((id) => id.policy === "public")?.id;
const videoTitle = asset?.meta?.title;
const createdAt = Number(asset?.created_at);
const duration = Number(asset?.duration);

const date = new Date(createdAt * 1000).toDateString();
const time = new Date(Math.round(duration) * 1000).toISOString().substring(14, 19);
---

<Layout>
  <h1>My Video Page</h1>
  <p>Title: {videoTitle}</p>
  <p>Upload Date: {date}</p>
  <p>Length: {time}</p>

  <MuxPlayer
    playbackId={playbackId}
    metadata={{video_title: videoTitle}}
  />
</Layout>
```


Using Mux video element

If you prefer a simpler alternative to Mux Player that provides browser support for HLS playback with automatic Mux Data analytics, you can use the ` web component:


```bash
npm install @mux/mux-video
```



```astro filename=src/components/SimpleVideoPlayer.astro
<script>import '@mux/mux-video'</script>

<mux-video
  playback-id="FOTbeIxKeMPzyhrob722wytaTGI02Y3zbV00NeFQbTbK00"
  metadata-video-title="My Astro Video"
  controls
  disable-tracking
></mux-video>
```


Event handling for uploads

You can listen for upload events and handle them with client-side scripts. Here's an example of handling upload events:


```astro filename=src/pages/upload-with-events.astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Mux from "@mux/mux-node";
import MuxUploader from "@mux/mux-uploader-astro";

const mux = new Mux({
  tokenId: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID,
  tokenSecret: import.meta.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET
});

const upload = await mux.video.uploads.create({
  new_asset_settings: {
    playback_policy: ['public'],
    video_quality: 'basic',
  },
  cors_origin: '*',
});
---

<Layout title="Upload with Event Handling">
  <MuxUploader
    id="my-uploader"
    endpoint={upload.url}
    pausable
    maxFileSize={50000}
  />

  <script>
    import type { MuxUploaderElement } from '@mux/mux-uploader-astro';

    const uploader = document.getElementById('my-uploader') as MuxUploaderElement;

    uploader.addEventListener('uploadstart', (event) => {
      console.log('Upload started!', event.detail);
    });

    uploader.addEventListener('success', (event) => {
      console.log('Upload successful!', event.detail);
    });

    uploader.addEventListener('uploaderror', (event) => {
      console.error('Upload error!', event.detail);
    });

    uploader.addEventListener('progress', (event) => {
      console.log('Upload progress: ', event.detail);
    });
  </script>
</Layout>
```
