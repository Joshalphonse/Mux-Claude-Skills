# Add high-performance video to your Elixir application

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/integrations/mux-elixir-sdk

Installation

Add mux to your list of dependencies in mix.exs.


```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mux, "~> 3.2.1"}
  ]
end
```


Quickstart

To start, we'll need a Mux access token. We'll put our access token in our application configuration.


```elixir
# config/dev.exs
config :mux,
  access_token_id: "abcd1234",
  access_token_secret: "efghijkl"
```


Then use this config to initialize a new client in your application.


```elixir
client = Mux.client()
```


You can also pass the access token ID and secret directly to client/2 function if you'd prefer:


```elixir
client = Mux.client("access_token_id", "access_token_secret")
```


Now we can use the client to upload new videos, manage playback IDs, etc.


```elixir
params = %{
  input: "https://example.com/video.mp4"
}
{:ok, asset, _} = Mux.Video.Assets.create(client, params);
```
