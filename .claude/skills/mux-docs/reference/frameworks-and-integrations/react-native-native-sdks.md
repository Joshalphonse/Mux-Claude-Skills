Bridging Native Mux SDKs

This guide covers when and how to bridge native Mux SDKs (iOS/Android) into your React Native app. Most developers won't need this - JavaScript solutions work great for 95% of use cases. But if you need advanced features or maximum performance, native bridging is an option.

Start with JavaScript first. Only consider native bridging if you have specific needs that can't be met with react-native-video and the patterns in this documentation.

When to Use Native SDKs

Consider native Mux SDKs when you need:

Advanced Features
- DRM (Digital Rights Management) - Full FairPlay (iOS) and Widevine (Android) support
- Advanced analytics - Native Mux Data integration with more detailed metrics
- Picture-in-picture - Better PiP support than JavaScript solutions
- Background playback - Robust background audio/video
- Offline playback - Download and play DRM-protected content offline

Performance
- Lower overhead - Native video rendering without JavaScript bridge
- Better memory management - Native memory handling for large video apps
- Smoother playback - Fewer dropped frames on older devices

Native Features
- AirPlay (iOS) - Seamless AirPlay integration
- Cast (Android) - Chromecast support
- System controls - Native lock screen controls
- Closed captions - Native caption rendering

When NOT to Use Native SDKs

❌ Don't use native SDKs if:
- Your JavaScript solution works fine
- You don't need DRM
- You want to avoid native development complexity
- Your team lacks iOS/Android experience
- You want easier maintenance and updates

✅ Stick with react-native-video if:
- Basic playback meets your needs
- You're using public or signed playback (no DRM)
- You want simpler codebases
- You need to ship quickly
- Cross-platform consistency is important

95% of React Native video apps work great with react-native-video. Only invest in native bridging if you have specific requirements that justify the added complexity.

Creating a Native Module

Bridging native Mux SDKs requires creating React Native native modules. Here's a high-level overview:

Architecture


```
JavaScript (React Native)
    ↕ (Bridge)
Native Module (Objective-C/Swift or Java/Kotlin)
    ↓
Native Mux SDK (iOS/Android)
```


Example: Bridging Mux Player iOS

Step 1: Create Native Module (ios/MuxPlayerModule.swift)


```swift
import Foundation
import MuxPlayerSwift
import React

@objc(MuxPlayerModule)
class MuxPlayerModule: RCTEventEmitter {

  var player: MuxPlayer?

  @objc
  func initializePlayer(
    _ playbackId: String,
    resolver: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
    rejecter: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
  ) {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      // Initialize Mux Player
      let playerView = MuxPlayerView()
      playerView.playbackId = playbackId

      self.player = playerView.player

      // Set up event listeners
      self.setupPlayerListeners()

      resolver(["success": true])
    }
  }

  @objc
  func play(
    _ resolver: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
    rejecter: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
  ) {
    player?.play()
    resolver(["playing": true])
  }

  @objc
  func pause(
    _ resolver: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
    rejecter: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
  ) {
    player?.pause()
    resolver(["playing": false])
  }

  private func setupPlayerListeners() {
    // Listen for player events and send to JavaScript
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
      self,
      selector: #selector(playerDidFinishPlaying),
      name: .AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTime,
      object: player?.currentItem
    )
  }

  @objc
  private func playerDidFinishPlaying() {
    sendEvent(withName: "onVideoEnd", body: [:])
  }

  // Required for RCTEventEmitter
  override func supportedEvents() -> [String]! {
    return ["onVideoEnd", "onProgress", "onError"]
  }

  override static func requiresMainQueueSetup() -> Bool {
    return true
  }
}
```


Step 2: Bridge to JavaScript (ios/MuxPlayerModule.m)


```objc
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(MuxPlayerModule, RCTEventEmitter)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(
  initializePlayer:(NSString *)playbackId
  resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
  rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject
)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(
  play:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
  rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject
)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(
  pause:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
  rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject
)

@end
```


Step 3: Create React Native Component


```tsx
// MuxPlayer.tsx
import { NativeModules, NativeEventEmitter, requireNativeComponent } from 'react-native';

const { MuxPlayerModule } = NativeModules;
const MuxPlayerView = requireNativeComponent('MuxPlayerView');

interface MuxPlayerProps {
  playbackId: string;
  onVideoEnd?: () => void;
  onProgress?: (progress: number) => void;
  onError?: (error: Error) => void;
}

export function MuxPlayer({ playbackId, onVideoEnd, onProgress, onError }: MuxPlayerProps) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize player
    MuxPlayerModule.initializePlayer(playbackId);

    // Set up event listeners
    const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(MuxPlayerModule);

    const endListener = eventEmitter.addListener('onVideoEnd', () => {
      onVideoEnd?.();
    });

    const progressListener = eventEmitter.addListener('onProgress', (event) => {
      onProgress?.(event.currentTime);
    });

    const errorListener = eventEmitter.addListener('onError', (event) => {
      onError?.(new Error(event.message));
    });

    return () => {
      endListener.remove();
      progressListener.remove();
      errorListener.remove();
    };
  }, [playbackId]);

  return (
    <MuxPlayerView
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 300 }}
      playbackId={playbackId}
    />
  );
}

// Export native methods
export const MuxPlayerAPI = {
  play: () => MuxPlayerModule.play(),
  pause: () => MuxPlayerModule.pause(),
};
```


Step 4: Use in React Native


```tsx
import { MuxPlayer, MuxPlayerAPI } from './MuxPlayer';

export function VideoScreen() {
  const playbackId = 'EcHgOK9coz5K4rjSwOkoE7Y7O01201YMIC200RI6lNxnhs';

  return (
    <View>
      <MuxPlayer
        playbackId={playbackId}
        onVideoEnd={() => console.log('Video ended')}
        onProgress={(time) => console.log('Progress:', time)}
      />

      <Button title="Play" onPress={() => MuxPlayerAPI.play()} />
      <Button title="Pause" onPress={() => MuxPlayerAPI.pause()} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Bridging Complexity

Creating native bridges involves:

iOS (Swift/Objective-C)
- ✅ Swift/Objective-C knowledge required
- ✅ Understanding of AVPlayer and AVKit
- ✅ React Native bridging APIs
- ✅ Memory management and threading
- ✅ CocoaPods for dependencies
- ⏱ Time investment: 1-2 weeks for full implementation

Android (Kotlin/Java)
- ✅ Kotlin/Java knowledge required
- ✅ Understanding of ExoPlayer
- ✅ React Native bridging APIs
- ✅ Activity lifecycle management
- ✅ Gradle for dependencies
- ⏱ Time investment: 1-2 weeks for full implementation

Maintenance
- Regular updates to match native SDK releases
- Testing on both platforms for each change
- Handling breaking changes in React Native or native SDKs
- Debugging across JavaScript ↔ Native bridge

---

Alternative: Use Expo Modules

For Expo users, Expo Modules provides a better developer experience:


```typescript
// MuxPlayerModule.ts (Expo Module)
import { requireNativeViewManager } from 'expo-modules-core';
import { ViewProps } from 'react-native';

export interface MuxPlayerViewProps extends ViewProps {
  playbackId: string;
  onVideoEnd?: () => void;
}

export default requireNativeViewManager<MuxPlayerViewProps>('MuxPlayer');
```


Expo Modules offer:
- Better TypeScript support
- Easier native module creation
- Cleaner bridging APIs
- Built-in event handling

Pros and Cons

Pros of Native Bridging

✅ Access to advanced features - DRM, PiP, native controls
✅ Better performance - Direct native rendering
✅ Platform features - AirPlay, Chromecast, system integration
✅ More control - Fine-grained control over player behavior
✅ Offline support - DRM-protected offline playback

Cons of Native Bridging

❌ Increased complexity - Two codebases (iOS + Android)
❌ Maintenance burden - Keep native modules updated
❌ Harder debugging - Debug across JavaScript and native layers
❌ Slower iteration - Native changes require rebuilds
❌ Team requirements - Need iOS and Android developers
❌ Risk of bugs - More code = more potential issues

Decision Framework

Use this decision tree to determine if you need native bridging:


```
Do you need DRM?
├─ Yes → Consider native bridging
└─ No → Do you need advanced features (PiP, AirPlay, Chromecast)?
    ├─ Yes → Consider native bridging
    └─ No → Do you have performance issues with react-native-video?
        ├─ Yes → Try optimization first, then consider native
        └─ No → **Stick with react-native-video** ✅
```


Questions to ask:
1. Can I achieve this with react-native-video?
2. Have I exhausted optimization options?
3. Do I have iOS/Android developers on the team?
4. Is the added complexity worth it?
5. Can I maintain this long-term?

If you answered "no" to questions 3, 4, or 5, stick with JavaScript solutions.

Recommendation

For most React Native + Mux apps:

1. Start with react-native-video ✅
   - Covers 95% of use cases
   - Simple to implement
   - Easy to maintain

2. Optimize JavaScript first
   - Follow Best Practices guide
   - Profile and fix performance issues
   - Consider caching and preloading

3. Only consider native bridging if:
   - You absolutely need DRM
   - JavaScript performance is insufficient after optimization
   - You have iOS/Android developers available
   - You're prepared for ongoing maintenance

4. If you do bridge:
   - Start with Expo Modules if using Expo
   - Focus on one platform first (iOS or Android)
   - Thoroughly document your bridge code
   - Set up comprehensive tests
   - Plan for long-term maintenance
