# Modify playback behavior

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/modify-playback-behavior

Playback modifiers are optional parameters added to the video playback URL. These modifiers allow you to change the behavior of the stream you receive from Mux.

Mux Video supports 2 different types of playback policies: public and signed. Playback modifiers are supported for both types of playback policies. However, the method to add them differs.

Query String with public playback URL

```text
https://stream.mux.com/{PLAYBACK_ID}.m3u8?{MODIFIER_NAME}={MODIFIER_VALUE}
```

Replace PLAYBACK_ID with your asset's public policy playback ID. Replace MODIFIER_NAME and MODIFIER_VALUE with any of the supported modifiers listed below in this document.

JWT Claim with signed playback URL


```text
https://stream.mux.com/{PLAYBACK_ID}.m3u8?token={TOKEN}
```

Replace PLAYBACK_ID with your asset's signed policy playback ID and TOKEN with the signature generated. Add modifiers to your claims body in the JWT payload. View the guide for Secure video playback for details about adding query parameters to signed tokens.
