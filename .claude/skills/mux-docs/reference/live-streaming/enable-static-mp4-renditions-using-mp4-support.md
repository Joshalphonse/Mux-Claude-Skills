# Enable static MP4 renditions using `mp4_support` (Deprecated)

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/enable-static-mp4-renditions-using-mp4-support

This guide describes using the mp4_support method of creating MP4s. This method is now deprecated though it continues to function. For more information on migrating to the new, more flexible static_renditions API, please refer to enabling static mp4 renditions

How to enable MP4 support

There is no additional cost for creating and storing MP4 files for plus and premium quality level assets.

For basic quality level assets, we do charge for MP4 storage, but encoding is free.

Delivery for MP4s has the same price-per-minute cost as HLS delivery.

Enabling MP4 renditions when you create an asset

You can add MP4 support to an asset when creating an asset by including the "mp4_support: " parameter.

The supported options are:
 capped-1080p: Produces a single MP4 file with the video resolution up to 1080p.
 audio-only: Produces a single M4A (audio-only MP4) file for a video asset.
 audio-only,capped-1080p: Produces both M4A and MP4 files for assets with video and audio, only the MP4 file for video-only assets, or only the M4A file for audio-only assets.
 standard (deprecated). Depending on the source video resolution, produces up to three MP4 files with different levels of resolution. We strongly recommend using one of the previous options, depending on your use case.

The files produced by each mp4_support option depends on the source asset type:
| mp4_support option | video asset | video-only asset | audio-only asset |
| -------------------| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| capped-1080p | capped-1080p.mp4 | capped-1080p.mp4| audio.m4a |
| audio-only | audio.m4a  | error | audio.m4a |
| audio-only,capped-1080p | audio.m4a and capped-1080p.mp4 | capped-1080p.mp4 | audio.m4a |
| standard | low.mp4, medium.mp4, high.mp4 | low.mp4, medium.mp4, high.mp4 | audio.m4a |

The standard option generates one or more renditions depending on your source video's resolution.
A video qualifies for a rendition if either its width or height meets the minimum threshold for that tier, regardless of aspect ratio.
Output renditions will never exceed the source video's resolution.

| Rendition | Minimum Resolution |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| low.mp4 | (always generated) |
| medium.mp4 | 640x360 |
| high.mp4 | 960x540 |

Here's an example of creating an asset with mp4_support enabled using the capped-1080p option:


```json
// POST /video/v1/assets
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/muxdemofiles/mux.mp4"
    }
  ],
  "playback_policies": [
    "public"
  ],
  "mp4_support": "capped-1080p"
}
```


Enable MP4 renditions after an asset has already been created

You can also add MP4 support retroactively by calling the update asset MP4 support API, as shown below.


```json
// PUT /video/v1/assets/{ASSET_ID}/mp4-support
{
  "mp4_support": "capped-1080p"
}
```


If you already have an asset with the standard option enabled and want to generate new static renditions with one of the capped-1080p, audio-only or audio-only,capped-1080p options, you need to make the following two update asset MP4 support API calls:

1. Update request with the mp4_support option set to none to first delete the existing static renditions
2. Update request with the mp4_support option set to one of the capped-1080p, audio-only, or audio-only,capped-1080p options

Enable MP4 renditions for a direct upload

To enable MP4 support for direct upload, you need to specify the same mp4_support field within new_asset_settings, as shown below:


```json
// POST /video/v1/uploads
{
  "cors_origin": "https://example.com/",
  "new_asset_settings": {
    "playback_policies": [
      "public"
    ],
    "mp4_support" : "capped-1080p"
  }
}
```


Enable MP4 renditions when a live stream finishes

If you want to enable MP4 support from the recorded version of a live stream soon after the live stream is finished, use the mp4_support property in the new_asset_settings when creating the live stream.


```json
// POST /video/v1/live-streams
{
  "playback_policies": [
    "public"
  ],
  "new_asset_settings": {
    "playback_policies": [
      "public"
    ],
    "mp4_support": "capped-1080p"
  }
}
```


Create the MP4 streaming URL

After adding MP4 support you'll see an additional key on the asset object called static_renditions. This is the object that will contain the information about which MP4s are available.

The static_renditions.status parameter refers to the current status of processing the MP4s. MP4s take longer to create than our default HLS version of the video, so they will not be ready immediately when the asset status is ready. Instead they will be ready when the static_renditions.status is ready, and a webhook of video.asset.static_renditions.ready is fired.


```json
{
  ...all asset details...
  "mp4_support": "capped-1080p",
  "static_renditions": {
    "status": "preparing"
  }
}
```


When the static_renditions.status field is ready, you will see the details of the MP4s available in an array under the files key.  The example below shows the files for the audio-only,capped-1080 option:

```json
{
  ...all asset details...
  "mp4_support": "capped-1080p",
  "static_renditions": {
    "status": "ready",
    "files": [
      {
        "name": "audio.m4a",
        "ext": "m4a",
        "bitrate":  {M4A_BITRATE},
        "filesize":  {M4A_FILESIZE}
      },
      {
        "name": "capped-1080p.mp4",
        "ext": "mp4",
        "height": {MP4_HEIGHT},
        "width":  {MP4_WIDTH},
        "bitrate":  {MP4_BITRATE},
        "filesize":  {MP4_FILESIZE}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


The MP4 or M4A streaming URL is compiled using the playback ID and one of the static_renditions.


```
https://stream.mux.com/{PLAYBACK_ID}/{capped-1080p.mp4, audio.m4a}
--
ex. https://stream.mux.com/abcd1234/capped-1080p.mp4
ex. https://stream.mux.com/abcd1234/audio.m4a
```


If you want a browser to download the MP4 file rather than attempt to stream it, you can provide a file name for the MP4 to save it via the download query parameter:


```
https://stream.mux.com/{PLAYBACK_ID}/{MP4_FILE_NAME}?download={FILE_NAME}
--
ex. https://stream.mux.com/abcd1234/capped-1080p.mp4?download=cats
```


For the deprecated standard option, the file names will be low.mp4, medium.mp4, high.mp4.

Webhooks

Your application can be automatically updated with the status of MP4 downloads for an asset through webhooks.

There are four related events you can receive.

| Webhook       | Description   |
| :------------ |:--------------|
|video.asset.static_renditions.preparing | Received when MP4 support is first requested |
|video.asset.static_renditions.ready |Received when the MP4 URL(s) are available and ready for use |
|video.asset.static_renditions.deleted |Received if MP4 support has been set to none via a PUT to the mp4-support endpoint |
|video.asset.static_renditions.errored |Received if an unexpected error happens while making the MP4 URLs available |

 For an audio-only asset: All mp4_support options will only produce a single M4A audio.m4a file.
 For a video asset: The  audio-only or audio-only,capped-1080p mp4_support options will produce an audio.m4a file.
* For a video-only asset: The audio-only,capped-1080p option will only produce a capped-1080p.mp4 file. MP4 generation will error for the  audio-only option.

Signed URLs with MP4 video

Mux videos have two types of playback policy, public or signed. If your playback_id is signed, you will need to also sign requests made for MP4 URLs.

You can check out how to do that in our signed URLs guide.

If you run into any trouble signing MP4 requests, please reach out to Mux Support and we'll be able to help.

Disable MP4 renditions

To disable MP4 support on an asset, you can use the update asset MP4 support APIs, setting mp4_support to none.


```json
// PUT /video/v1/assets/{ASSET_ID}/mp4-support
{
  "mp4_support": "none"
}
```
