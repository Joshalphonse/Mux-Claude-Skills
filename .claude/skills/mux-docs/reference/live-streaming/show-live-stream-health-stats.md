# Show live stream health stats to your streamer

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/show-live-stream-health-stats

In this guide you will learn how to use the Live Stream Health Stats API in order to embed the live stream health stats for a particular live stream ID into your applications. A common use case is when you want to show the live stream stats to your streamer during a live event, so that the streamer can monitor the status and take actions when issues occur.

  The Live Stream Stats API is not a 1:1 mapping of what you see on the Live Stream Health page in the Mux dashboard.

You will use JSON Web Tokens to authenticate to this API.

1. Understand Live Stream Stats
The Live Stream Stats API returns Stream Drift Session Average, Stream Drift Deviation From Rolling Average, and Status. Before we dive into each of them, understanding a couple of terms here might be helpful:

 Wallclock time: Also called the real-world time.
 Stream drift: The difference between elapsed media time and elapsed wallclock time. For example, if your encoder has been connected for 10 seconds and it has sent 5 seconds of media during that time, then your current stream drift would be 5s.

Now keep reading below for the metrics the API returns and their definitions.

Stream Drift Session Average
Stream Drift Session Average is the running average of stream drift for the lifetime of an ingest connection. It applies a smoothing function to the potentially jagged, fluctuating raw metric. Use this metric as an indication of the average offset between the elapsed wallclock time and media time throughout the whole session.

The value we return from the API is measured in miliseconds and is continuously updated with each measurement taken. It is reset whenever the encoder disconnects.

Stream Drift Deviation From Rolling Average
To get an indication of whether the current drift is consistent (good) or growing (bad), use Deviation From Rolling Average. It is the difference between current stream drift and current stream drift rolling average. The rolling average only takes the last ~30s of data into account, so it represents the recent drift, rather than measurements taken potentially long time ago. Disparities between current drift and the rolling average can be a good indicator because session average moves slower and may not reflect the latest status.

Use this metric to understand whether the stream is experiencing issues at the moment. When it is, the Deviation From Rolling Average will likely be high.

Status
The status returned from the Live Stream Health API could be any of the following values: excellent, good, poor, or unknown.

 excellent: The Stream Drift Deviation From Rolling Average is less than or equal to 500ms
 good: The Stream Drift Deviation From Rolling Average is less than or equal to 1s but greater than 500ms
 poor: The Stream Drift Deviation From Rolling Average is greater than 1s
 unknown: We are unable to calculate the stream drift. This is usually because the live stream is inactive and/or we have not received any data about it for a few minutes.

Use status as an indicator of the latest health status of the live stream ingest. A common use case is to render color coded UI for your streamer's ease-of-use based on the status information, such as green, yellow, or red. You can also check out our pre-built UI to monitor the status by going to the Mux Dashboard for the specific live stream.

2. Create a Signing Key

Signing keys can be managed (created, deleted, listed) from the Signing Keys settings of the Mux dashboard or via the Mux System API.

  When making a request to the System API to generate a signing key, the access
  token being used must have the System permission. You can confirm whether your
  access token has this permission by going to Settings > API Access Token. If
  your token doesn't have the System permission listed, you'll need to generate
  another access token with all of the permissions you need, including the
  System permission.

When creating a new signing key, the API will generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair and return the private key and a generated key ID; the public key will be stored at Mux to validate signed tokens. Store the private key in a secure manner.

You probably only need one signing key active at a time and can use the same signing key when requesting live stream stats for multiple live streams. However, you can create multiple signing keys to enable key rotation, creating a new key and deleting the old only after any existing signed URLs have expired.

Example request


```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-u ${MUX_TOKEN_ID}:${MUX_TOKEN_SECRET} \
'https://api.mux.com/system/v1/signing-keys'
```


Example response


```json
// POST https://api.mux.com/system/v1/signing-keys
{
  "data": {
    "private_key": "(base64-encoded PEM file with private key)",
    "id": "(unique signing-key identifier)",
    "created_at": "(UNIX Epoch seconds)”
  }
}
```


  Be sure that the signing key's environment (Staging, Production, etc.) matches
  the environment of the live streams you would like to call for! When creating a signing
  key via API, the environment of the access token used for authentication will
  be used.

This can also be done manually via the UI. If you choose to create and download your signing key as a PEM file from UI, you will need to base64 encode it before using it with (most) libraries.


```bash
❯ cat /path/to/file/my_signing_key.pem | base64
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktL...
```


3. Generate a JSON Web Token

The following JWT claims are required:

| Claim Code | Description                | Value                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sub      | Subject of the JWT         | The ID for which counts will be returned                                                                                                                           |
| aud      | Audience (identifier type) | live_stream_id (Mux Video Live Stream ID) |
| exp      | Expiration time            | UNIX Epoch seconds when the token expires. Use this to ensure any tokens that are distributed become invalid after a period of time.                               |
| kid      | Key Identifier             | Key ID returned when signing key was created                                                                                                                       |

  Live Stream ID is available to Mux
  Video customers only and is generated by Mux. Be sure to double check both
  the query ID type and value!

Expiration time

Expiration time should be at least the duration of the live stream. When the signed URL expires, you will no longer be able to receive live stream stats data from the API.

 See the related video documentation

4. Signing the JWT

The steps can be summarized as:

1. Load the private key used for signing
2. Assemble the claims (sub, aud, exp, kid etc) in a map
3. Encode and sign the JWT using the claims map and private key and the RS256 algorithm.

There are dozens of software libraries for creating and reading JWTs. Whether you’re writing in Go, Elixir, Ruby, or a dozen other languages, don’t fret, there’s probably a JWT library that you can rely on. For a list of open source libraries to use, check out jwt.io.

  The following examples assume you're working with either a private key
  returned from the API, or copy &amp; pasted from the Dashboard, not when
  downloaded as a PEM file. If you've downloaded it as a PEM file, you will need
  to base64 encode the file contents.

5. Making a Request

Supply the JWT in the resource URL using the token query parameter. The API will inspect and validate the JWT to make sure the request is allowed.

Example:


```bash
curl 'https://stats.mux.com/live-stream-health?token={JWT}'
```


Response:


```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "ingest_health": {
        "updated_at": "2022-11-14T17:32:23",
        "stream_drift_session_avg": 384,
        "stream_drift_deviation_from_rolling_avg": 12,
        "status": "excellent",
        },
    },
  ],
}
```


 stream_drift_session_avg is the session average of stream drift. Use this to represent the overall health of the stream.
 stream_drift_deviation_from_rolling_avg is the delta between the current stream drift and the rolling average. Use this to represent the latest stream health.
