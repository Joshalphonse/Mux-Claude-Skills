# Monitor Bitmovin Player Android

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-bitmovin-android

This documents integration instructions for Bitmovin's Bitmovin Player library, version 3.x and 2.x.

The Mux integration with Bitmovin Player is built on top of Mux's core Java SDK, and the full code can be seen here: muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-bitmovin-android.

Add the Mux SDK to your project using one of the following approaches:

Add Gradle dependency on the Mux Bitmovin Player SDK
Add the Mux Maven repository to your Gradle file:

```text
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://muxinc.jfrog.io/artifactory/default-maven-release-local"
    }
}
```


Next, add a dependency on the Mux Data Bitmovin Player SDK. We support both minapi16 and minapi21 as separate artifacts.

The current version is v0.5.1. Additional releases can be found on our releases page.

Bitmovin Player support
We support version 3.11.1 of Bitmovin Player. Support for additional versions is planned


```groovy
implementation 'com.mux.stats.sdk.muxstats:muxstatssdkbitmovinplayer_r3_11_1:[CurrentVersion]'
```


First, create the CustomerPlayerData and CustomerVideoData objects as appropriate for your current playback, and be sure to set your ENV_KEY.


```java
import com.mux.stats.sdk.core.model.CustomerPlayerData;
import com.mux.stats.sdk.core.model.CustomerVideoData;
import com.mux.stats.sdk.core.model.CustomerViewData
import com.mux.stats.sdk.core.model.CustomData;
import com.mux.stats.sdk.core.model.CustomerData;

CustomerPlayerData customerPlayerData = new CustomerPlayerData();
customerPlayerData.setEnvironmentKey("YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_KEY_HERE");

CustomerVideoData customerVideoData = new CustomerVideoData();
customerVideoData.setVideoTitle(intent.getStringExtra("YOUR_VIDEO_TITLE"));

CustomerViewData customerViewData = new CustomerViewData();
customerViewData.setViewSessionId("A26C4C2F-3C8A-46FB-885A-8D973F99A998");

CustomData customData = new CustomData();
customData.setCustomData1("YOUR_CUSTOM_STRING_HERE");

CustomerData customerData = new CustomerData(customerPlayerData, customerVideoData, customerViewData);
customerData.setCustomData(customData);
```


Next, create the MuxStatsSDKBitmovinPlayer object by passing your Android Context (typically your Activity), a Bitmovin PlayerView instance, a player name, and the customer data objects.


```java
import com.mux.stats.sdk.muxstats.MuxStatsSDKBitmovinPlayer;
...
// Make sure to monitor the player before calling `prepare` on the Bitmovin Player instance
muxStatsBitmovinPlayer = new MuxStatsSDKBitmovinPlayer(
  this, player, "demo-player", customerData);
```


In order to correctly monitor if the player is full-screen, provide the screen size to the MuxStatsSDKBitmovinPlayer instance.


```java
Point size = new Point();
getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getSize(size);
muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.setScreenSize(size.x, size.y);
```


In order to determine a number of viewer context values as well as track the size of the video player, set the player view.


```java
muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.setPlayerView(playerView);
```


Finally, when you are destroying the player, call the MuxStatsSDKBitmovinPlayer.release() function.


```java
muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.release()
```


After you've integrated, start playing a video in your player. A few minutes after you stop watching, you'll see the results in your Mux data dashboard. Login to the dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your env_key and look for video views.

In the Java SDK, options are provided via the objects within the CustomerData object.

All metadata details except for envKey are optional, however you'll be able to compare and see more interesting results as you include more details. This gives you more metrics and metadata about video streaming, and allows you to search and filter on important fields like the player version, CDN, and video title.

For more information, see the Metadata Guide.

Changing the video

There are two cases where the underlying tracking of the video view need to be reset. First, when you load a new source URL into an existing player, and second when the program within a singular stream changes (such as a program within a live stream).

Note: You do not need to change the video info when changing to a different source of the same video content (e.g. different resolution or video format).

New source

When you change to a new video (in the same player) you need to update the information that Mux knows about the current video. Examples of when this is needed are:

 The player advances to the next video in a playlist
 The user selects a different video to play

This is done by calling muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.videoChange(CustomerVideoData) which will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view. See Metadata for the list of video details you can provide. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with video.

It's best to change the video info immediately after telling the player which new source to play.

New program (in single stream)

In some cases, you may have the program change within a stream, and you may want to track each program as a view on its own. An example of this is a live stream that streams multiple programs back to back, with no interruptions.

In this case, call muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.programChange(CustomerVideoData). This will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view, creating a new video view. See Metadata for the list of video details you can provide. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with video.

Error tracking

By default, Mux's integration with Bitmovin Player automatically tracks fatal errors as thrown by Bitmovin Player. If a fatal error happens outside the context of Bitmovin Player and you want to track it with Mux, you can call muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.error like this:


```java
// Error code: integer value for the generic type of error that
// occurred.
// Error message: String providing more information on the error
// that occurred.
// For an example, the HTML5 video element uses the
// following: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaError
// for codes and messages. Feel free to use your own codes and messages
int errorCode = 1;
String errorMessage = "A fatal error was encountered during playback";
MuxErrorException error = new MuxErrorException(errorCode, errorMessage);
muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.error(error);
```

Note that muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.error(MuxErrorException e) can be used with or without automatic error tracking. If your application has retry logic that attempts to recover from Bitmovin Player errors then you may want to disable automatic error tracking like this:


```java
muxStatsBitmovinPlayer.setAutomaticErrorTracking(false)
```


It is important that you only trigger an error when the playback has to be abandoned or aborted in an unexpected manner, as Mux tracks fatal playback errors only.
