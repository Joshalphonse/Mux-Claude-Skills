# Monitor Kaltura Player (iOS and tvOS)

**Source:** https://docs.mux.com/_guides/developer/monitor-kaltura-ios

Mux Data Mux-Stats-Kaltura supports iOS 13.0 or newer and tvOS 13.0 or newer. The Mux integration with Kaltura is built on top of Mux's core Objective-C SDK, and the full code can be seen here: muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-kaltura-ios.

This SDK is built with XCFramework bundle type and supports Mac Catalyst.

Installing with SwiftPM

1. In Xcode click "File" > "Swift Packages" > "Add Package Dependency..."
1. The package repository URL is https://github.com/muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-kaltura-ios.git
1. Click next.
1. Select dependency resolution options. We recommend setting the "Rules" to install the latest version and choosing the option "Up to Next Major".

Note that MUXSDKStatsKaltura has a dependency on MuxCore, so you will see that MuxCore gets installed as well.

> As of Xcode 14.3.1 integrating the Mux SDKs as part of a shared framework using Swift Package Manager is now supported.

Installing with CocoaPods

To install with CocoaPods, modify your Podfile to use frameworks by including use_frameworks! and then add the following pods to your Podfile:


```
pod 'Mux-Stats-Kaltura', '~>3.0'
```


This will install Mux-Stats-Kaltura and the latest current release of our core Objective-C Library. There will be no breaking updates in major versions, so you can safely run pod update for future versions.

Next, add correct import statement into your application.


```swift
import MUXSDKKaltura
```


The example below uses monitorPlayer:player:playerName:customerData:.

The playerName parameter is a string that identifies this instance of your player. When calling destroyPlayer later on, you will need this string. Each instance of a player that runs simultaneously in your application should have a different playerName.

For more complete examples check the demo apps in the repo.

After you've integrated, start playing a video in your player. A few minutes after you stop watching, you'll see the results in your Mux data dashboard. Login to the dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your env_key and look for video views.

The only required field is env_key. But without some more metadata the metrics in your dashboard will lack the necessary information to take meaningful actions. Metadata allows you to search and filter on important fields in order to diagnose issues and optimize the playback experience for your end users.

Metadata fields are provided via the MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData and MUXSDKCustomerVideoData objects.

For the full list of properties view the header files for this interfaces:

- MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData.h
- MUXSDKCustomerVideoData.h

For more details about each property, view the Make your data actionable guide.

There are some cases where you may not have the full set of metadata until after the video playback has started. In this case, you should omit the values when you first call  monitorPlayer. Then, once you have the metadata, you can update the metadata with the  setCustomerDataForPlayer  method.

Changing the Video
​
There are two cases where the underlying tracking of the video view need to be reset. First, when you load a new source URL into an existing player, and second when the program within a singular stream changes (such as a program within a live stream).

Note: You do not need to change the video info when changing to a different source of the same video content (e.g. different resolution or video format).
​
New source
​
When you change to a new video (in the same player) you need to update the information that Mux knows about the current video. Examples of when this is needed are:
​
-   The player advances to the next video in a playlist
-   The user selects a different video to play
​
This is done by calling  videoChangeForPlayer  which will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with  video_.
​
It is required to call  videoChangeForPlayer  immediately before telling the player which new source to play.
​

​
New program (in single stream)
​
In some cases, you may have the program change within a stream, and you may want to track each program as a view on its own. An example of this is a live stream that streams multiple programs back to back, with no interruptions.
​
In this case, call  programChangeForPlayer:name:customerData. This will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view, creating a new video view. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with  video.

Usage with Google Interactive Media Ads (IMA)

If you are using Google Interactive Media Ads and the PlayKit_IMA SDK, you can track ad playback events by installing the mux-stats-google-ima-kaltura-ios companion package.

Please note: A fully functioning PlayKit_IMA integration is required for ad playback tracking in your iOS or tvOS application.

Add the following to your Podfile and run pod install

```
'Mux-Stats-Google-IMA-Kaltura' ~> '2.0.0'
```


Initialize the Mux monitor with MUXSDKStats.monitorPlayer. Create an listener instance by calling MUXSDKImaKalturaListener(playerBinding: playerBinding, player: player).
Start dispatching the events by calling start on the listener instance.


```swift
import MUXSDKStatsKaltura

// Follow the instructions from pod 'PlayKit_IMA' to set up
// your IMA plugin configuration in the loadPlayer method
//
// When you call `monitorPlayer:withPlayer:playerName:customerData:`
// from your ViewController, you will get back a MUXSDKPlayerBinding object
let playerBinding = MUXSDKStats.monitorPlayer(
  player: player,
  playerName: self.playerName,
  customerData: data
)

// Use the MUXSDKPlayerBinding object and the Player instance to initialize the MUXSDKImaKalturaListener class
// and call start on the listener object
let listener = MUXSDKImaKalturaListener(playerBinding: playerBinding, player: player)
listener.start()
```


You can find a complete example here.

Track orientation change events

You can optionally track  orientationchange  events. To use this functionality, call the  orientationChangeForPlayer  method.
​
These events will show up on the events log on the view views page.

Handling errors manually

By default,  automaticErrorTracking  is enabled which means the Mux SDK will catch errors that the player throws and track an  error  event. Error tracking is meant for fatal errors. When an error is thrown it will mark the view as having encountered an error in the Mux dashboard and the view will no longer be monitored.
​
If you want to disable automatic and track errors manually you can do by passing in  automaticErrorTracking: false  to the  monitorPlayer  method that you are using.
​
Whether automatic error tracking is enabled or disabled, you can dispatch errors manually with  dispatchError.
