# Monitor ExoPlayer

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/developer/monitor-exoplayer

This documents integration instructions for Google's ExoPlayer library, version 2.x. ExoPlayer versions before 2.0 are not supported. As of version 3.0.0 of Mux's integration with ExoPlayer, only versions of ExoPlayer greater than or equal to 2.10.x are supported.

The Mux integration with ExoPlayer is built on top of Mux's core Java SDK, and the full code can be seen here: muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-exoplayer.

Add Gradle dependency on the Mux ExoPlayer SDK
Add the Mux Maven repository to your Gradle file:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://muxinc.jfrog.io/artifactory/default-maven-release-local"
    }
}
```


Next, add a dependency on the Mux Data ExoPlayer SDK. Supported versions of ExoPlayer are:
 - r2.10.6
 - r2.11.1
 - r2.12.1
 - r2.13.1
 - r2.14.1
 - r2.15.1
 - r2.16.1
 - r2.17.1
 - r2.18.1
 - r2.19.1
 - amznPort (see below)

There is typically API compatibility within an ExoPlayer major-minor version, so you should be able to pair one of the versions listed above with any player sharing the same major-minor version (e.g., the ExoPlayer r2.12.1 version of the Mux ExoPlayer SDK works with ExoPlayer r2.12.0 and r2.12.2 equally well).

Add a dependency to your Gradle file using the Mux SDK version and an ExoPlayer version listed above in the following format:

```gradle
api 'com.mux.stats.sdk.muxstats:MuxExoPlayer_(ExoPlayer SDK version with underscores):(Mux SDK version)'
```


Example using Mux ExoPlayer SDK 2.7.2 and ExoPlayer version r2.16.1:

```gradle
api 'com.mux.stats.sdk.muxstats:MuxExoPlayer_r2_16_1:2.7.2'
```


Configure ProGuard/R8

If you're using ProGuard or R8, you'll need to add the following line to your app's proguard rules file (eg, proguard-rules.pro). This won't change anything about your app binary, it just suppresses a known warning


```
-dontwarn com.google.ads.interactivemedia.v3.api.**
```


Amazon ExoPlayer Port
In addition to the versions above, the Mux Data ExoPlayer SDK also supports Amazon's official ExoPlayer port for Amazon Devices. If you are monitoring ExoPlayer on an Amazon device, you can get that version with the following line:

```gradle
api 'com.mux.stats.sdk.muxstats:MuxExoPlayer_amznPort:(Mux SDK version)'
```


For an example integration, you can see the demo application within muxinc/mux-stats-sdk-exoplayer which integrates Mux into the ExoPlayer demo application.

First, create the CustomerPlayerData and CustomerVideoData objects as appropriate for your current playback


```kotlin
val customerData = CustomerData().apply {
        customerVideoData = CustomerVideoData().apply {
          // Data about this video
          // Add or change properties here to customize video metadata such as title,
          //   language, etc
          videoTitle = "Mux ExoPlayer Android Example"
          // ExoPlayer doesn't provide an API to obtain this, so it must be set manually
          videoSourceUrl = videoUrl
        }
        customerViewData = CustomerViewData().apply {
          // Data about this viewing session
          viewSessionId = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
        }
        customerViewerData = CustomerViewerData().apply {
          // Data about the Viewer and the device they are using
          muxViewerDeviceCategory = "kiosk"
          muxViewerDeviceManufacturer = "Example Display Systems"
          muxViewerOsVersion = "1.2.3-dev"
        }
        customData = CustomData().apply {
          // Add values for your Custom Dimensions.
          // Up to 5 strings can be set to track your own data
          customData1 = "Hello"
          customData2 = "World"
          customData3 = "From"
          customData4 = "Mux"
          customData5 = "Data"
        }
```


Next, create the MuxStatsExoPlayer object by passing your Context (typically your Activity), your ENV_KEY, the ExoPlayer instance, and the customer data object you just created.


```kotlin
muxStatsExoPlayer = exoPlayer.monitorWithMuxData(
      context = requireContext(),
      envKey = "YOUR_ENV_KEY_HERE",
      playerView = playerView,
      customerData = customerData
    )
```


If you haven't set your playerView already, do so now. We recommend this in order to determine a number of viewer context values as well as track the size of the video player.


```java
muxStatsExoPlayer.setPlayerView(simpleExoPlayerView.getVideoSurfaceView());
```


Finally, when you are destroying the player, call the MuxStatsExoPlayer.release() function.


```java
muxStatsExoPlayer.release()
```


After you've integrated, start playing a video in your player. A few minutes after you stop watching, you'll see the results in your Mux data dashboard. Login to the dashboard and find the environment that corresponds to your env_key and look for video views.

Note For ExoPlayer v2.15 and below

On older supported versions of ExoPlayer, Mux prefers that you pass an instance of SimpleExoPlayer specifically, instead of any ExoPlayer. In the latter case, however, some metrics and errors may not be available, such as upscaling metrics. Updating to ExoPlayer r2.16.0 or higher will remove this limitation


```kotlin
muxStatsExoPlayer = exoPlayer.monitorWithMuxData(
      context = requireContext(),
      envKey = "YOUR_ENV_KEY_HERE",
      playerView = playerView,
      customerData = customerData
    )

```

or in java:

```java
// Make sure to monitor the player before calling `prepare` on the ExoPlayer instance
muxStatsExoPlayer = new MuxStatsExoPlayer(this, "YOUR_ENV_KEY_HERE", player, playerView, customerData);
```


Options are provided to this SDK via the objects within the CustomerData object.

All metadata details are optional, however you'll be able to compare and see more interesting results as you include more details. This gives you more metrics and metadata about video streaming, and allows you to search and filter on important fields like the player version, CDN, and video title.

There is one caveat with ExoPlayer; ExoPlayer does not provide an API to retrieve the current source URL from the player. Due to this, CustomerVideoData has a method allowing you to set via CustomerVideoData.setVideoSourceUrl(String url). Setting this value will allow you to see the source URL as well as the dimension Source Hostname within the dashboard.

For more information, see the Metadata Guide.

Changing the video

There are two cases where the underlying tracking of the video view need to be reset. First, when you load a new source URL into an existing player, and second when the program within a singular stream changes (such as a program within a live stream).

Note: You do not need to change the video info when changing to a different source of the same video content (e.g. different resolution or video format).

New source

When you change to a new video (in the same player) you need to update the information that Mux knows about the current video. Examples of when this is needed are:

 The player advances to the next video in a playlist
 The user selects a different video to play

This is done by calling muxStatsExoPlayer.videoChange(CustomerVideoData) which will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view. See Metadata for the list of video details you can provide. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with video.

It's best to change the video info immediately after telling the player which new source to play.

New program (in single stream)

In some cases, you may have the program change within a stream, and you may want to track each program as a view on its own. An example of this is a live stream that streams multiple programs back to back, with no interruptions.

In this case, call muxStatsExoPlayer.programChange(CustomerVideoData). This will remove all previous video data and reset all metrics for the video view, creating a new video view. See Metadata for the list of video details you can provide. You can include any metadata when changing the video but you should only need to update the values that start with video.

Manually set when a video is being played full-screen

For most use cases, the SDK is capable of detecting whether or not a video is being played full-screen. Specifically, it can do so in the case where the player view is the same size as the device display (excepting ActionBars and other framework window decoration).

For other uses cases (non-overlaid controls, window decoration via plain Views, etc) you may need to tell the SDK when the user switches to full-screen.

If you are using SimplePlayerView or a similar ExoPlayer UI component, you can set the full-screen flag from the OnFullScreenModeChangedListener.


```kotlin
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    // If you are using SimplePlayerView, StyledPlayerView, etc
    playerView = findViewById(R.id.my_player_view)

    playerView.setFullscreenButtonClickListener { isFullScreen ->
      // Set presentation based on which mode is requested
      if(isFullScreen) {
        muxStats.presentationChange(MuxSDKViewPresentation.FULLSCREEN)
      } else {
        muxStats.presentationChange(MuxSDKViewPresentation.NORMAL)
      }
      // Handle moving to fullscreen playback with your code
    }
  }
```


Error tracking

By default, Mux's integration with ExoPlayer automatically tracks fatal errors as thrown by ExoPlayer. If a fatal error happens outside the context of ExoPlayer and you want to track it with Mux, you can call muxStatsExoPlayer.error like this:


```kotlin
// Error code: integer value for the generic type of error that
// occurred.
// Error message: String providing more information on the error
// that occurred.
// For an example, the HTML5 video element uses the
// following: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaError
// for codes and messages. Feel free to use your own codes and messages
val errorCode = 1
val errorMessage = "A fatal error was encountered during playback"
val errorContext = "Additional information about the error such as a stack trace"
val error = MuxErrorException(errorCode, errorMessage, errorContext)
muxStatsExoPlayer.error(error)
```

Note that muxStatsExoPlayer.error(MuxErrorException e) can be used with or without automatic error tracking. If your application has retry logic that attempts to recover from ExoPlayer errors then you may want to disable automatic error tracking like this:


```kotlin
muxStatsExoPlayer.setAutomaticErrorTracking(false)
```


It is important that you only trigger an error when the playback has to be abandoned or aborted in an unexpected manner, as Mux tracks fatal playback errors only.

Usage with Google Interactive Media Ads (IMA)

If you are using Google's IMA SDK to play back ads within your Android application, you can configure Mux to monitor the ad performance by passing your instance of AdsLoader to muxStatsExoPlayer.monitorImaAdsLoader(adsLoader).

ExoPlayer r2.12.x and Up


```kotlin
// For example, within the r2.12.x demo application
// PlayerActivity.getAdsLoader
adsLoader = ImaAdsLoader.Builder(context = this)
    /*
     * This replaces `monitorImaAdsLoader` method because in r2.12.x ImaAdsLoader
     * will create google.v3.AdsLoader on adRequest, which means that monitorImaAdsLoader
     * Will always receive null pointer and will be unable to recieve add events.
     */
    .setAdErrorListener(muxStats.getAdErrorEventListener())
    .setAdEventListener(muxStats.getAdEventListener())
    .build()
```


ExoPlayer pre-r2.12.x


```kotlin
// Within setting up the AdsMediaSource
sdkFactory = ImaSdkFactory.getInstance()
adsLoader = sdkFactory.createAdsLoader(this)
muxStatsExoPlayer.monitorImaAdsLoader(adsLoader)
```


As of version 1.3.0 and later, the Mux SDK for ExoPlayer supports firing an event when the playback orientation changes. You can trigger this by calling muxStatsExoPlayer.orientationChange(MuxSDKViewOrientation orientation), passing either MuxSDKViewOrientation.LANDSCAPE or MuxSDKViewOrientation.PORTRAIT depending on the current orientation of the player.

Java and Android Gradle Plugin Build Compatibility
Starting with version 2.6.0, the Mux SDK for ExoPlayer requires JDK 11 and version 7.0 or greater of the Android Gradle Plugin. This is only a requirement for build compatibility. The Mux SDK for ExoPlayer will remain bytecode-compatible with Java 1.8.

If you are updating from version 2.5.9 or lower, you may need to:
  - Update Android Studio to version 2020.x or greater
  - Update your dependency on the Android Build Tools plugin to 7.0.0 or greater
  - Update Gradle in gradle-wrapper.properties to 7.0.2 or greater
  - Ensure your Android Studio is using JDK 11:
    - Go to Android Studio Settings
    - Go Build, Execution and Deployment -> BuildTools -> Gradle
    - If the Gradle JDK option is not set to a Java 11 JDK, click the dropdown and select a Java 11 JDK. It should be the default on Studio 2020.x

v0.4.3
 - Fix an issue where a NullPointerException may occur during playback of a video while tracking bandwidth metrics.

v0.4.2
 - Added API method programChange(CustomerVideoData customerVideoData), for use when inside of a single stream the program changes. For instance, in a long-running live stream, you may have metadata indicating program changes which should be tracked as separate views within Mux. Previously, videoChange might have been used for this case, but this would not work correctly, and you would not necessarily have seen the subsequent views show up.
 - Fixed a bug where under poor network conditions, an exception raised as a result of a network request could result in not tracking the view correctly subsequently (such as missing rebuffer tracking after this point).

v0.4.1
- Remove the listeners on the ExoPlayer object when release is called.
  - This fixes and issue where the application may crash after calling release
    if the ExoPlayer instance is removed while the SDK is still listening to
    it.

v0.4.0
- [feature] Support bandwidth throughput metrics on video segment download
  for HLS and Dash streaming.
- breaking change The signature for getAdaptiveMediaSourceEventListener
  and getExtractorMediaSourceEventListener has been changed. These methods
  are used to enable throughput metrics tracking for ExoPlayer versions
  _before_ r2.8.0, and now require that the streaming protocol type is
  passed as the first parameter. The type is the same as is returned from
  this ExoPlayer API call.

v0.3.0
- breaking change The signature for the MuxStatsExoPlayer constructor
  has changed, and now requires an additional parameter (the first) to be
  and Android Context reference.
- abstract more core logic into mux-stats-sdk-java
- [build] rename and copy build artifacts

v0.2.2
- add back in previously missing methods to MuxStatsExoPlayer:
  - videoChange
  - setPlayerSize
  - error
  - setAutomaticErrorTracking

v0.2.1
- add support for ExoPlayer r2.7.x
- add support for ExoPlayer r2.8.x
- update to v2.1.0 of mux-stats-sdk-java
