There are two cases where the underlying tracking of the video view need to be reset:

1.  New source: When you load a new source URL into an existing player.
1.  New program: When the program within a singular stream changes (such as a program change within a continuous live stream).

Note: You do not need to change the video info when changing to a different source of the same video content (e.g. different resolution or video format).
