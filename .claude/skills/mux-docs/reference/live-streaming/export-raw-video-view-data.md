# Export raw video view data

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/export-raw-video-view-data

View data can be exported from Mux Data for aggregation and reporting in your data infrastructure. Views are available individually using the Views API or in bulk with the export methods: daily CSV exports or streaming exports.

Full data exports are available via the Exports API. This API is available for Mux Data customers on Media plans.

Use this API to get a list of CSV files available for download. Files are available to download for seven days after they are generated. Each CSV file is a single day of data and includes every single dimension collected by Mux, for each single video view. The table below details each of these data fields.

The Versions column indicates what fields are included in each version. Newer export versions will include the latest columns available. Some columns may be empty based on the features enabled. From version 2 onward, fields are sorted in alphabetical order. Older versions of the export may have fields in a different order, please refer to the export file for the most accurate ordering. Please contact support to change the export version that is generated.

We strongly suggest you build the file import to use the field names rather than ordinal order so additional fields can be added to the file without causing an error.

Streaming Exports are available on Mux Data Media plans. Learn more about Mux Data Plans or contact support.

Mux Data supports streaming exports of video views to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream or Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic in your cloud account. Views are sent to Kinesis or Pub/Sub as they complete and are made available to retrieve from the stream within about one minute after the view ends.

Each message is a single view, with all of the metadata and metrics, and the event timeline for the view. The view data can be stored in your long-term storage for aggregation and reporting.

This method of access is most useful for customers who want to update metrics on a rolling basis throughout the day or are embedding metrics in a user-facing application feature and need faster updates than once per day.

Setting up a streaming export
Streaming exports can be configured in the Streaming Exports settings in your Mux dashboard. See the setup guide for your platform for more information on setting up an export:
-  Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
-  Google Cloud Pub/Sub

Message format
Messages are in either JSON format or Protobuf (proto2) encoding. You can choose between the two formats when setting up the streaming export in the Mux Dashboard -> Settings -> Streaming Export -> New streaming export page.

For Protobuf encoding, every message uses the VideoView message type defined in the export Protobuf spec, which is available in the mux-protobuf repository. Use the latest Protobuf spec when creating schemas or generating code.

The fields in the Protobuf definition match those used in the latest version of the Exports API. The available fields are noted in the table below.

View handling
A view can be updated after it has been exported. This will be expressed with a record of the latest version of the view being emitted to the stream. When processing views, make sure you're able to handle multiple or duplicate records for each view ID (view_id). The view_id can be used as a unique primary key for each view record.

Mux API Value: field name in the CSV file or streaming export

Unit: unit of the field, such as text, percentage, or bits per second. Note that all units of type Time are represented as timestamps in UTC.

Type:
- Dimension: metadata about the view
- Metric: metrics calculated by Mux
- Score: score calculated by Mux

The daily CSV export files are generated based on the specific version that is configured and include the fields specified in the section above.

Sample CSV export files are available to download, for reference:
 Version 2
 Version 3
 Version 4

The protobuf definition for Streaming Exports of video views is available in the mux-protobuf repository. Please subscribe to this repository for updates to the protobuf definition.

The JSON format streaming export contains identical fields as the protobuf-encoded format.

Backward compatibility

The Streaming Export schema provided by Mux Data is backward compatible, meaning that each schema version guarantees that it will still work upon future upgrades. Customers do not need to worry about breaking changes.

When to upgrade the schema?

When Mux adds new fields into the Streaming Export, we will upgrade the schema version. Without taking any actions you will not be impacted by it: the fields that you used to get will keep working as normal, and the new fields introduced since your last upgrade will not be sent to you either. The benefit of designing it this way is that you will not be getting new fields without knowing.

For customers who want to get the new fields, read below to see the how-tos.

How to upgrade the schema?

If integrated with Google Pub/Sub

If your Google Pub/Sub topic is schematized, once a schema is associated with a topic, you can no longer change that schema. This means that customers using Google Pub/Sub for Streaming Export must take a couple of steps to move to a new topic that is associated with a new schema.

 Create a new topic in Google Pub/Sub with upgraded schema
 Point the Mux Data Streaming Export to that new topic
 Go to Mux Dashboard → Settings → Streaming Export → Click Upgrade.

If your Google Pub/Sub topic is schemaless, which it must be if you want to use JSON, you do not need to create new topics or reconfigure your streaming export, but to get the new fields released from Mux, customer needs to do the 3rd step as mentioned above.

If integrated with Amazon Kinesis

 If using protobuf message format, make sure you get the latest protobuf definition from Mux public repo. Subscribe to the mux-protobuf repository to receive updates.
 Go to Mux Dashboard → Settings → Streaming Export → Click Upgrade button.
