# Report on your Mux costs

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/_guides/pricing/report-on-mux-costs

Mux provides a billing breakdown which gives you transparency into your Mux costs, with historical context that helps you spot trends and make informed decisions. From this page, you can chart your costs and purchases over time, track your plan credit spending, and see your credit balances. It includes information about your last six billing cycles. Any invoices that have been issued in the six most recent billing cycles are shown but it does not include usage in the current cycle that has not yet been invoiced.

You can find the Billing Breakdown in the Billing area of the Mux dashboard.

Overview

The Last 6 Billing Cycles chart makes it easy to see how the costs of usage fluctuate month-to-month. The billing period can include multiple invoices if more than one was generated by Mux.

In the bar chart:
 Committed Charges (Orange): Your plan’s committed costs, this can be Video, Data, or general committed amounts. For example, for a Starter Plan, the commitment would be $10 per month.
 Previous Cycle’s Overages (Purple): Costs from usage in the previous month that goes above the committed amount, if any.
 Credits Applied (Purple-striped): Reductions of the dollar amount that is billed in that month from plan credits that were purchased or promotional credits received.
 Tax (Red): Taxes added to the bill, based on your local jurisdiction.

If you hover over the bar chart, the tooltip shows the exact dollar amounts for each of these values and the total amount that is billed for each month.

The highlight box on the right side of the page shows the total dollar amount owed in the most recent billing period, the change from the previous month, and any promo credits that were applied.

The detailed breakdown shows you exactly how your costs break down across the major areas of spending. Not all of these will be present for every customer and they won’t be shown if they don’t apply.
 Video Usage: the dollar amount of consumption-based Video SKUs that were used.
 Data Usage: the dollar amount of consumption-based Data SKUs that were used.
 Video Committed: the dollar amount that was committed to spend on Video usage
 Data Committed: the dollar amount that was committed to spend on Data usage, which is usually Monitored Views.
 Support: the cost for support. For some customers, this is only charged once per year so it may not be included in the table, depending on the date of the charge.
 Plan Credits Purchase: the amount of plan credits that were purchased. These may be used over multiple months and the balance will be shown in the “Plan Credits Remaining”. For some customers, this is only charged once per year so it may not be included in the table, depending on the date of the charge.
 Plan Credits Applied: the dollar amount that was paid from a plan credits balance.
 Total: the total dollar amount that was billed to you from your Mux usage.
 Plan Credits Remaining: the amount of plan credits that remain after the month’s charges were applied to an existing balance.

Rows that are highly variable include a percentage below the value which indicates the percentage change, increase or decrease, from the previous month.

While the overview gives you the overall picture, we also provide breakdowns at the product-level. The detailed breakdowns show you exactly how your costs break down within each product.
