# Make your dimensions actionable with metadata

**Source:** https://mux.com/docs/developer/make-your-data-actionable-with-metadata

One of Mux Data's core concepts are dimensions, which are the attributes of a video view that you can use to search, filter, and segment your video performance metrics.

While some of these dimensions are populated automatically, Mux Data allows you to provide details about the video and environment that either can't be detected automatically, can't be accessed if the video fails to load, or should be overridden.

Each dimension corresponds with a metadata key which can be used to set these values. While all metadata details except for env_key are optional, some may be necessary to calculate certain metrics and you'll see more helpful results as you include more.

Dimension Details

Level

Each dimension is either considered basic or advanced. All dimensions are available for the standard retention period of 100 days. Long Term Metrics only support basic dimensions. If you are interested in Long Term Metrics, please reach out to Mux Support.

  Long Term Metrics are available on Mux Data Custom Media plan. Long Term Metrics are available on Media Plans. Learn more about Mux Data Plans or contact support.

Scoping

Many of Mux Data's dimensions are scoped to specific categories. Based on the category, they may have different behavior in terms of how these details are updated.

 Video details (prepended by video_) describe the current video that's playing and are all reset automatically when changing the video. This metadata might come from your internal CMS or video management system.
 Player details (prepended by player_) describe the player configuration that's being used and should be set whenever monitoring is started on a new player. They do not reset when the video is changed.
 All other details will persist until explicitly changed.

Type

There are three types of dimensions based on their availability.

Tracking: Enables tracking of additional metrics but are unavailable as dimensions.

Limited: Appear as attributes of a view on the individual view page as well as in the API.

Full: Can be used as filters and breakdowns in aggregate reports, in the video view page and in the API.

High Priority Configurable Metadata

The following dimensions are the most important fields whose metadata keys you should populate in order to get the basic functionality from Mux Data.

  For viewer_user_id you should not use any value that is personally identifiable on its own (such as email address, username, etc.). Instead, you should supply an anonymized viewer ID which you have stored within your own system.

| Dimension Name | Key Name | Unit | Type | Level | Description |
|:-|:-|:-|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Environment | env_key | Unique ID | Required | N/A | Your env key from the Mux dashboard. This field ensures that your data goes into the correct environment. Note this was previously named property_key |
| Video ID | video_id | Text | Full | basic | Your internal ID for the video. Defaults to the Mux External ID if enabled for Assets and Livestreams hosted by Mux. |
| Video Title | video_title | Text | Full | basic | Title of the video being played (e.g.: Awesome Show: Pilot). Defaults to the Mux Video Title if enabled for Assets and Livestreams hosted by Mux. |
| Viewer ID | viewer_user_id | Unique ID | Full | adv | An ID representing the viewer who is watching the stream. Use this to look up video views for an individual viewer. If no value is specified, a unique ID will be generated by the SDK. Note: You should not use any value that is personally identifiable on its own (such as email address, username, etc.). Instead, you should supply an anonymized viewer ID which you have stored within your own system. |

Optional Configurable Metadata

The following dimensions can be set manually using the metadata key name and will be reported by Mux Data. The key name provided below is the snake_case used by Web SDKs. Keynames for iOS and Android SDK use camelCase and may differ in some cases. Review API documentation for API key names.

Set Metadata with Session Data

Metadata is normally set using code in the SDK configuration. However, some video metadata can also be set using Session Data key/value pairs in the HLS manifest. This method makes it easier to communicate values to the Mux player SDK without having to side-channel information to the client or change client-side code in order to configure metadata for a view.

Some common use cases where this is helpful are, for example, setting a view session id that comes from a backend system which can be used to associate a playback view with the requests that were made to a CDN or being able to easily capture which experiments a viewer is participating in without having to communicate that to the player.

HLS Session Data, which is represented in an HLS master playlist using the EXT-X-SESSION-DATA tag, is a key/value pair that can be read by the player. When the master playlist is loaded into a video player integrated with a Mux Data SDK that supports extracting Session Data, the Session Data keys that use the io.litix.data prefix will be included in the Mux Data view as dimension metadata the same as if you had configured the value from the SDK configuration code.

  This feature is intended for developers using their own custom video delivery pipeline. HLS Session Data is set by Mux Video when videos are viewed; injecting your own HLS Session Data into Mux Video content is not currently supported.

The Session Data tags are interpreted as follows from the master playlist:

```text
Tag: #EXT-X-SESSION-DATA
Key: DATA-ID="io.litix.data.[dimension_name]"
Value: VALUE="dimension value"
```


The dimension names available to be set from the master playlist:
 video_
 custom_
 experiment_name
 view_session_id
 viewer_user_id

The following is an example of Session Data tags in a master playlist:

```text
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:7
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS

#EXT-X-SESSION-DATA:DATA-ID="io.litix.data.experiment_name",VALUE="abr_test:true"
#EXT-X-SESSION-DATA:DATA-ID="io.litix.data.view_session_id",VALUE="12345ABCD"

#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2516370,AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH=2516370,CODECS="mp4a.40.2,avc1.640020",RESOLUTION=1280x720
...
```

The Session Data tags contained in a master playlist would result in the Experiment Name dimension set to abr_test:true and View Session ID dimension set to 12345ABCD.

  We're aware of a crash that may occur in AVPlayer Data SDK versions 2.12.0 - 3.5.0 when processing HLS Session Data that is prefixed with io.litix.data. AVPlayer Data SDK integrations that process HLS Session Data not prefixed with io.litix.data are not affected. Custom integrations that use the Objective-C MuxCore SDK and do not depend on the AVPlayer Data SDK are not affected.

iOS/Android Metadata

In iOS and Android SDKs, names are converted to lowerCamelCase setters and getters. For example, to set the Video Stream Type field in iOS or Android, use videoStreamType instead of video_stream_type.

In the Objective-C SDKs, options are provided via the MUXSDKCustomerPlayerData, MUXSDKCustomerVideoData, MUXSDKCustomerViewData, and MUXSDKCustomData objects. See the header directories in MuxCore.xcframework from the latest release for a complete list of names.

In the Java SDK, options are provided via the CustomerPlayerData, CustomerVideoData, and CustomData objects. Use your IDE to inspect these objects' API.
