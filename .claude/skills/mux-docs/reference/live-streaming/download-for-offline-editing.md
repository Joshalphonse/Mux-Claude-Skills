Why download the master

When a video is ingested into Mux we store a version of the video that's equivalent in quality to the original video, we call this the master. The max_resolution_tier of an asset will determine the master file's resolution e.g. a max_resolution_tier of 2160p will result in a 4K master file. All of the streamed versions of the video are created from the master, and the master itself is never streamed to a video player because it's not optimized for streaming.

There are a few common use cases where Mux may have the only copy of the original video:
 You're using Mux live streaming and the only copy is the recorded asset after the event
 You're using Mux's direct upload feature so Mux has the only copy
 You deleted the original version from your own cloud storage because Mux is already storing a high quality version for you

When this is the case, there are a number of reasons you may want to retrieve the master version from Mux, including:
 Allowing users to download the video and edit it in a tool like Final Cut Pro
 Archiving the video for the future, for example if you're un-publishing (deleting) a video asset from Mux
 Moving your videos to another service

Enabling master access will create a temporary URL to the master version as an MP4 file.
You can use this URL to download the video to your own hosting, or provide the URL to a user to download directly from Mux.

The URL will expire after 24 hours, but you can enable master access on any asset at any time.

  The methods described here are available only via the Mux API; you won't find these features in the Mux Dashboard.

Enable master access

If you want the master be available soon after a video is uploaded, use the master_access property when creating an asset.


```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "url": "VIDEO_URL"
    }
  ],
  "playback_policies": [
    "public"
  ],
  "video_quality": "basic",
  "master_access": "temporary"
}
```


You can also add it afterward by updating the asset.

Enable master access when a live stream finishes

If you want to download the recorded version of a live stream soon after the live stream is finished, use the master_access property in the new_asset_settings when creating the live stream.


```json
{
  "playback_policies": [
    "public"
  ],
  "new_asset_settings": {
    "playback_policies": [
      "public"
    ],
    "video_quality": "basic",
    "master_access": "temporary"
  }
}
```


Retrieving the URL to the master

After master access has been requested, a new object called master will exist on the asset details object.


```json
{
  ...all asset details...
  "master_access": "temporary",
  "master": {
    "status": "preparing"
  }
}
```


Making the master available is an asynchronous process that happens after an Asset is ready, or in the case of a live streamed asset, after the live_stream_completed event. Because of this, the master object has a status property that gives the current state of the master, starting with preparing.

In most cases, the master will be available very quickly. When it's ready the status will be updated to ready, and a new url property will exist on the object. This is the URL you can use to download the master yourself, or to let a user download the master.


```json
{
  ...all asset details...
  "master_access": "temporary",
  "master": {
    "status": "ready",
    "url": "https://mezzanine.mux.com/ABC123/mezzanine.mp4?skid=foo&signature=bar"
  }
}
```


Customizing the filename

The filename of the downloaded file can be controlled by appending the download query parameter to the URL returned from the API, for example:


```http
https://mezzanine.mux.com/ABC123/mezzanine.mp4?skid=foo&signature=bar&download=desired_filename.mp4
```


This will cause the browser to download the file with the name desired_filename.mp4 instead of the default name.

  It is important that you do not modify the URL or query parameters returned from the API in any other way than to add the download parameter.

Webhooks for master access

Your application can be automatically updated with the status of master access for an asset through webhooks.

There are four related events you can receive.

| Webhook       | Description   |
| :------------ |:--------------|
|video.asset.master.preparing | Received when master access is first requested |
|video.asset.master.ready |Received when the URL to the master is available |
|video.asset.master.deleted |Received if master access has been set to none via a PUT to the master-access endpoint |
|video.asset.master.errored |Received if an unexpected error happens while making the master available |
